## An Annotated Corpus for Causal Analysis of Mental Health Issues in Social Media Posts

This repository is created to support the paper ['CAMS: An Annotated Corpus for Causal Analysis of Mental health on Social media'](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2022/pdf/2022.lrec-1.686.pdf) (accepted (published) in Language Resources and Evaluation Conference LREC'2022) 

We introduce a new dataset for Causal Analysis of Mental health illness in Social media posts (CAMS). We first introduce the annotation schema for this task of causal analysis. The causal analysis comprises two types of annotations, viz, causal interpretation and causal categorization. We show the efficacy of our scheme in two ways: (i) crawling and annotating 3155 Reddit data and (ii) re-annotate the publicly available SDCNL dataset of 1896 instances for interpretable causal analysis. We further combine them as CAMS dataset.
