"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

Any advice is welcome.  Thank you~",5,"social isolation,no friends  college drop out,,no friends,playing video games all the time"
"This is quite a lot, but I really hope at least one person will read through. This means the world to me.

He's a great person. He constantly puts others over himself and he treats me amazingly. This is the man I can see a future with, and he does too. But his depression and anxiety causes him to act in ways he didn't intend, and it affects the relationship negatively. For example, sometimes he doesn't seem enthusiastic to do many things, he has a negative attitude on just about everything, and loses motivation to do anything except stay home. He constantly has anxiety attacks, and often misses classes because it is so bad and he can't get out of bed. It's been like this since the beginning, and I've tried everything to support him. I stay with him through the attacks, I try to give him motivation to get out of bed, and I constantly shower him with love and appreciation.

It started to affect me as well. I started having panic attacks and feeling quite depressed all the time. It's caused me to break up with him about 2 months ago, as I decided that maybe this isn't in my best interest since it's been affecting me so negatively. I didn't want to constantly be brought down, and knew that I would have to deal with this for the rest of my life if I wanted to stay with him.

After a week of talking it out after the breakup, we decided to just take a 2 month break and work on ourselves and problems in our relationship. I had self image problems, wasn't very patient, and could be quite stubborn sometimes, and it certainly affected how I treated him and the problems in our relationship. Taking care of him also made me forget about self-care. I'm better than ever, have improved on myself, made friends and stopped being so reliant on him, and I feel ready to go back in with a more positive outlook on myself and the relationship. However, it is still very hard for him, and although I feel like I've improved and changed tremendously over the course of 2 months, he's still struggling to be more positive and achieve his goals (eat healthier, lose weight, etc). I don't want to be the only person who has reached a great place, only to find that he's still stuck in such a negative place.

He was on antidepressants, but they made it so much worse and made him suicidal. I've tried to get him to go to therapy, he says he hates therapists and that they don't help/make it worse. He's had bad experiences and I've tried to ask him if we could go together, if we could at least try once, but he won't budge. I've gifted him a self-help book about depression, I've tried to give him little advices about things he could do that have helped other people, but he gets very upset and tells me ""it doesn't work like that"" and doesn't want me to help. I've tried to do the things he wants to accomplish with him, such as asking him if we wants to go for a walk with me, or I'll ask if he wants to go workout with me. The only thing I can do now is let him handle it on his own (as that's what he's asked me to do), and although he at least now has hope for himself, he doesn't seem to want to do much or believe many things will help. He hates when I bring things up like ""science has shown that..."" and gets upset. How do I get him to at least try things?

I know that hidden underneath the mental health problems is an energetic and amazing person, as it shows through all the time. He's told me that when he was younger, he used to be extremely hyper and the complete opposite, but as he got older and his mental illness got worse, he started becoming more mellow and less enthusiastic about things.

There has to be something I'm missing to be able to communicate with him more effectively. I know that you can't love someone's depression away. I'm not asking how I can get rid of it, I just want advice on how I can help him take steps to help it at least. There's countless people who have found a way to cope with their depression, and I want him to be able to too. I know it won't happen right away, but I think with small steps it could be manageable.

Thank you so much.

tl;dr: My boyfriend's depression is ruining our relationship and causing many problems. I've been on a journey of self-improvement myself, and have learned a lot that I believe can help him. What can I do to help, and how can I get him to actually try to better himself when he doesn't want to do anything to help himself?",4,"breakup, Need to vent, share "
"Like right now. Just sitting here back in my home town during the holidays. Still fighting wicked depression and anxiety, and having to fly back across country in two weeks. 

Just sitting here alone at the kitchen table listening to some Linkin Park style music, sipping on a Stella and I realized how often I get caught in this daze and how I almost enjoy it. 

Like I‚Äôm allowing the pain in. Soaking in it. The music obviously amplifies it. 

I think about the decisions I‚Äôve made that have caused me greater pain. More stress. 

I think about what my future holds. If I can make it until then.

I think about the present. If I‚Äôm meeting everyone‚Äôs standards that they all know of me.

Think, think and more thinking. Sometimes mixed with tears. Sometimes angers. But always with self loathing.

"So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. ¬†I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish for¬† expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,¬† she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

"Seriously, just what is the point in living? I can't understand why we're all supposed to live a long life, and why the hell does anyone genuinely enjoy being alive? It just seems like everything you do is just fucking around until you die. Nothing really matters. Like all there is in life is just trying not to be miserable and one day you die. Who gives a fuck if it's at 80 or at 20, it doesn't matter. I've come to accept that I'm never going to kill myself, but what the fuck is the point if all I'm doing is just waiting to die anyway? Get a decent career or live your whole life unemployed and homeless, the end result is the same. I just can't seem to justify trying to enjoy life when all there is at the end is the same no matter what the fuck I do. It seems like everyone's reasons for why you shouldn't kill yourself revolve around the people around you: if you kill yourself you'll make other people sad. But who the hell cares? All the people who'll be sad you're gone are going to die sooner or later anyway. It's all so fucking pointless. I just don't enjoy anything this world has to offer. All the earthly pleasures everyone else seem to enjoy just do absolutely nothing for me. I can't find any reason as to why I should even bother. Life isn't beautiful, it's full of hardship, disappointment and misery. And then you fucking die anyway. Even if the bad times are really as temporary as everyone says, so are the good times.

"I guess I'm looking for 3rd party opinions and maybe a little support if anyone else is in the same predicament. TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.

So now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. 

Is there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... 

I almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either. In fact, some of the studies I'm reading say that I may even be less likely to experience remission from ECT based on my absent response to medications as well as the length of my episode.

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

"Friends,

On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. 

With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience.

A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing!

Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone!

How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it!

So the thing is, i really want to leave this world at my own terms, every day is more painful than the last - physically and mentally.

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

I'm sorry if it was barely coherent. I lost my train of thought quite a few times. I think the total time it took me to write this was around 2 hours because I kept having to force myself to continue.

Sorry it's such a long post. I just needed someone to go to because I don't have anyone right now.

P.S. I'm sorry if this is a duplicate. I deleted my first post immediately after posting it out of regret, but am forcing myself to leave it this time.",4," trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, both starting med school so they're typically busy, A dumped me on Christmas "

"I‚Äôm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it‚Äôs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She‚Äôs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I‚Äôd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she‚Äôs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn‚Äôt go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good,‚Äù and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I‚Äôve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it‚Äôll stop hurting so much. What‚Äôs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master‚Äôs degree. She‚Äôs very school smart and has always done very well. I‚Äôm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I‚Äôm going to support her but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She‚Äôs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she‚Äôs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I‚Äôve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I‚Äôve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I‚Äôve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can‚Äôt get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it‚Äôs almost a comforting thought.

"4 am, can't sleep, as always. I really need to get this out of my chest. I apologize for the long text, but I really need some advice. My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.

It all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. 

 Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. 

My only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.

I wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by.

"i ended 2016 as a recent graduate from a top notch university with a degree in probably the most unemployable field, 30k+ in debt, back at home, and cut off ties with all friends.

i predicted that 2017 would bring me a mediocre job i could've gotten in high school, that i probably wouldn't last a few months at that job, that my parents would be paying off my loans because i can't, and that i would probably stay in my room 90% of the year.

it all became true. i lasted only the training period of my job and resigned 1 week into the first full week of work. my parents' have paid 8 months for my student loans. i'm not paying rent. i'm well fed. and despite having only seen friends only 3 days at the beginning of the year then ending them off with an argument or complete silence on my end, i'm okay with it. birthday and holiday greetings unreplied to. concerned voicemails and texts gradually decreasing from daily to weekly, to monthly, to never.

as for 2018, i only predict the same. no contact with friends. me still leeching off of my parents. maybe they'll snap one day and tell me to go back to a job that i'll only end up resigning yet again because of anxiety. maybe i'll stay at the job out of guilt.

it's gotten to a point where i'm not even sad for myself. i've just accepted it. i'm just one of those examples of the ""smart"" kid growing up, following the rules, the teacher's pet that becomes unsuccessful because they only know how to live by what others tell them to do. yet, i can't even succeed in the system because once i finally made mistakes, i never knew how to cope, even up to now. and that's where i'm at. in this limbo of being an ""adult"" yet living as if i were a toddler. maybe the saddest part is my parents tolerate it.

I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.

In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.

I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off.

Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didn‚Äôt. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didn‚Äôt even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldn‚Äôt find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually it‚Äôs what started EVERYTHING. And it‚Äôs all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people I‚Äôve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and I‚Äôve stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...we‚Äôve hit the present. I‚Äôve stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But that‚Äôs ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm suicidal but no one knows. I can‚Äôt tell anyone...I won‚Äôt tell anyone.At least personally. This, what I‚Äôm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now you‚Äôve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. There‚Äôs so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact I‚Äôm pretty sure I already have.

"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about.  I mean, if I am depressed on May 3rd, I am not also upset that I was depressed on May 3rd last year too, because it cannot help but escape my notice.  But I know I was depressed on New Year's Eve of 2016, and every year I can remember before that.  It's the same every year, and that makes me feel even worse than I normally do.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable.  Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse.  I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed.  Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away.  But every year have to realize that I was wrong.  I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier this year, but now I realize that I was wrong last year and I will be wrong this year too.  I would not be thinking about any of this if it weren't New Year's Eve.",5,it marks another year during which I was totally miserable

Hi, again here, yeah... M18. So, yeah, I think I‚Äôm going crazy... I ran out of my medicine about 5 days ago or so... I‚Äôve been on it for a month. Felt really out of myself honestly... Wasn‚Äôt sad, but I wasn‚Äôt happy either. Something like a zombie? Did some research... Depersonalization... 

Oh well, I stopped taking it not because I wanted to, but because my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt give refills unless you go and see him personally so he can see you, understandable, except the fact that I have to pay $40 for each appointment? Plus the medicine... Yeah... I don‚Äôt know about that...

I‚Äôm getting very frustrated and I honestly think of jumping out of my balcony... But, sadly, I can‚Äôt kill myself... So, again, I don‚Äôt know! Oh man...

 I‚Äôve been smoking cannabis these past months, tried it once and, well, I don‚Äôt really have friends, I mean, I consider them as friends but when your friends has depression, has been in a 72-hour watch, and other bunch of stuff, you should be worried right? Not them... Sad, sad, sad... (For me). But yeah, again, I don‚Äôt think the cannabis is making me go crazy just because I smoke only before going to sleep and I just take about 5 hits from a one-hitter I have, which I would say is about, maybe like, 0.2g each time I hit it? Maybe even less actually, but yeah, that‚Äôs the amount.

Oh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, I‚Äôm bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, but I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time, which feels bad... 

That‚Äôs how I feel, I think... So, I don‚Äôt know... I guess I‚Äôll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I don‚Äôt get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself... Hope everyone‚Äôs having a good day I guess?

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"My finals were coming up. I screwed them. I passed somwhow. I was depressed. I had a hard time explaining why I was like this to my family and friends. I wanted him. He didn't. I started cutting my arm and all, hoping he'd get sympathetic and stay with me. I didn't care what the reason was. Love or whatever. I just wanted. Him. 

Things happened. And we broke up. I was with another guy. I thought that would just be a rebound thing but right now, almost three and a half years later, we're still going strong. 
That chapter of my life was over. I was happier. But it took almost a year and a half to completely get over him. My ex. 

Down to reason 2 Now. 
2.  Moving away for college. I thought that's just the change that I needed in life but I was wrong. I hated it there in college. It was so lonely. I had Friends. But no one to actually hang out with. I was alone. Wanting to go back home where everything was familiar. But that wasn't possible. I tried taking with my mom and dad. But they wouldn't listen. So I asked stuck. I wasn't doing good in class. I was trying. I got better in classes. But mentally iy was hard. 

Then came pleurisy. A lung condition. And a sudden attack of asthma. Pericarditis. And some other minor things. 
Sick and alone. I started getting bitter. Negativity surrounded Me. Life seemed useless. There was nothing to look forward to.  Nothing to live for. I had friends and family and a significant other who loved me a lot and I loved him back. But none of that seemed important enough to live for. 
I tried taking to him. Explaining why I was acting the way I was but I guess after sometime he got fed up. He understood me but not too well.  

To him it was like me making negativity and sadness a hobby. But that wasn't the case. He tried. He really tried all that he could. But I was in too deep. He told me to force myself to be happy, think happy and be happy, but it's not so easy you know?

You'll only know how it is if you feel it yourself. 
I was stuck. I started cutting my arm and taking high doses of whatever Med I could find and sleeping pills. I wanted to sleep forever. To die. I started planning and plotting the best ways to die painlessly.  I was a wimp, a pussy. I wanted to die but I was too chicken to actually do it. 
I walked out In the middle of the night multiple times wandering around aimlessly trying to clear my mind, to make a decision. It was useless. I wanted to walk up in front of a car or a bus and get hit and die. I tried that. I got scared and never succeeded. 


Now a year later, when my medical conditions are fine and I finally thought I was over it all. I started feeling sad one again last night. Like life was meaningless.  Nothing to look forward too. 

I want to die
Again

I'm scared that everything will change in the future. Nothing will be the same. I'm not the kind of person that can look forward to the future. I want to cling on to the past I don't know why. 

I'm sad

I'm stupid and useless and overly emotional.

"You know those times where absolutely everything is just falling apart that you can almost time it by your watch for when the next thing will blow up? Well, there was car issues, pipes froze in my house (because I was dumb), more stuff went and then yesterday I lost a friend because saying that I was lonely  and I mentioned she hasn't visited my new place yet = ""I want to fuck you big time"". We were in the same depression mental health group for 5 weeks together, so she should have understood what I was meant rather than this girl logic and then blocking me without appeal.

Anyways! That isn't the end of it. This one is a totally isolated case from the last but I lost ANOTHER friend. Back to back days. The house is falling down and it decides to drop the toilet on my head for good measure when it's crumbling around me (and it's filled with crap). Anyways! I'll give the quick version. We met on Tinder. Talked for 2 months, had sex a few times a month ago. She was busy with work for the last couple of weeks coming up on Xmas. I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied on the 25th. We talked about meeting up when she was back in town and she said she would let me know with a smiley emoticon.. Normal fare right? Not with passive aggression in play... We didn't chat these entire 5 days until she messaged me in the morning today... I was completely blown away by how fucking dumb this was. I'll just copy paste it...

""Hey XXXXXX, I've had some time to think and, I'll be honest, I don't think I want to see you again. The first time we met I told you that I'm an egalitarian, and so far you have somehow managed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic and I just can't see past that. Whatever this was was fun for a bit, but it was ruined for me by all the hateful shit you say. Maybe take some time and figure out why you see the world the way you do.""

Out of ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I looked back over my entire SMS history to find absolutely anything off key and I couldn't find a single thing. It gets even more stupid and this is how I knew I was dealing with a completely fucked person and it wasn't anything I did.

I replied to her ""I hope one day you develop a mental disease so I can come chop you down at your knees"" (referring to her cutting me apart over my severe depression altering how positively I see the world and hoping that what goes around comes aroubd) and this fucking nut responds to me ""a normal person wouldn't blah blah blah, you *albeist* fuck"". She COMPLETELY loses the plot and insinuates that I hate disabled people because I hoped that she got her just desserts with someone shitting on her when she's vulnerable like I am... Like.. I can't make this stuff up guys.. 

That's where the ball stops with me and I just let her have it. So much BS packed into this and continually tell her ""what is your deal, I don't get it"" and ""you know you're busting down a sweet guy for no reason right?""

This is an open and shut case. We have here a nut case. Rhyme time. She's one of those people that takes everything way too seriously and makes life a real misery for people that don't conform to her exact wording/lifestyle.

THIS was the most fucked up thing though.... We talked for 2 entire months and there was absolutely no scent of crazy fucker to be smelt. She snuck right up on me and suckerpunched me with this nonsense. This is a lesson that everyone should learn. People are really fucking awesome at faking being a nice person that's there for you and if you so happen to have higher stakes such as a child or a joint bank account with one of these sleeper cells, that is some really scary shit and it could hurt a lot of us..

Anyways, I'm just kind of numb to all of this bad news lately.. It hasn't really hurt me like a break up with a loved one would. But it makes me look inward and wonder if I'm a bad person? We only ever shared happy times and laughs and I tried to convey that I'm a sweet person (her car was vandalized and I was offering to come down and assist her and I only knew her for 2 weeks. Stuff like that) but then this almost conspiracy like fog comes back around me and fucks yet another relationship up. What does everyone think of this one?

(I have to add that this is a person whom conversed with me for many months and did me several times. She had no problem fucking a bigot because I'm not one and I don't think if anyone who had that big of a problem with those types of people, would have sex with someone like that.

"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really don‚Äôt know what happened and I really don‚Äôt wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we don‚Äôt get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1,"been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence,have zero-self worth,she blocked me from her social,After 4 failed attempts,just not exist, lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow "
"I dread this time of year for myself.

Others talk about their plans, they take pictures and videos of themselves going out, they have kisses at midnight. I'll be at home. Probably eat some chinese food and watch a movie. 

It was like this last year too. Just don't have friends to go out with anywhere. Single. It gnaws at me. I just want to have some fun.

I'm basically mid-twenties now too. So goodbye the miniscule amount of fun times I've had, hello real world. Too old to be going out, and I didn't do a whole lot of that. Also been thinking of mistakes and how much of a loser I am, how everything's fucked up. Another shitty year ends.

"Today, I barely ate anything at all. I had an appetite, I was hungry, but I just wasn't interested in eating. So I made the most low-effort thing I could get away with - a sandwich - ate that, and went back to bed, even though I was clearly still hungry. I just didn't care. Didn't want to put out the effort.

Now my stomach is sore, and it hurts so much, I can't sleep. I just felt absolutely bored with living today. 

This is the most sucky thing about depression. The thing that's hardest to talk to anyone about - the fact that *most of the time, I really have no will to live*. 

Today there was no reason for me not to end it. Not any that I could think of. I basically went through the day just thinking of all the people that would be upset if I did. And telling myself to hold off for a while, because they always seem so convinced that things will get better.

But it's kind of scary. Is this how it's going to end? I just become apathetic enough to end it all?",5,"really have no will to live,kind of scary, apathetic"

I saw so much pain and suffering and few hopeful pieces of advice, and i would like to add to this in some way. I have felt bad about myself for the longest time. No one tells you as a kid that there‚Äôs gonna be low moments in your life and there isn‚Äôt a guide on how to get through them. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, like I shouldn‚Äôt feel the way I do or say the things I say, but I realize that I‚Äôd never trade that for the world. I understand myself so much better now. I‚Äôm unique, funny, quirky, friendly, social and truthful. Not because other people say so, but because I believe that to be the truth. I don‚Äôt wake up and slap on an adjective, I become the person I want to be and then I live my life. What I want to get across is that each of us have a really powerful choice (albeit a really difficult choice with a lot of commitment) to decide how we get to shape ourselves and our lives. I‚Äôm poor, I can‚Äôt drive just yet (I‚Äôm 17 btw) and it‚Äôs hard to get to work.

Tonight was a hard blow and I nearly didn‚Äôt make it, but I‚Äôll never give up. I‚Äôll never perish when I can make the choice to be strong. I chose how I live and only I can make the change and see it through. Anyone can make a choice, but only the strong stay with it.

"I'm trapped.

I have a job that I can't quit, because my family is reliant on the health benefits, and the income of course, and I'm in a field where I can't just simply find an upwardly mobile position. I also do a rather specific thing so my skill set is not easily translatable to other jobs - IOW I can't even make a lateral move. At this point, I can't go up, I cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). Otherwise I could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won't really be significant nor enough to live off.

I feel trapped.

This is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that's dragging me down. They have health issues, and my job's benefits cover those. But they also have a number of other problems. I don't want to blame my problems on someone else but here's the problem: I've come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. My spouse needs to change. But I can't make them do that. I can't ask or suggest it. If I do I'm met with resistance. My only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which I've been doing for 20+ years. But here's the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and I've come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. Now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where I see it as my spouse's fault that my child is this way. My spouse hasn't been diagnosed, but I'd say they are a hoarder. So is the child. My spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. So is the child. I could go on and on but the basic deal is that I could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it's too much to bear.

It may be my fault for being an ""enabler"" and letting them walk all over me - maybe I'm too weak, I don't know, but I don't feel it's right to force someone else to do something. But I also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.

It doesn't help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.

I think you have to have grounds for a divorce. I don't want to get a divorce - I don't want to be that person - I want it to work out - and it makes me feel like I'm giving up, and running away, which is not what I'm supposed to do. But again, I'm not strong enough to face this issue.

My spouse's issues have also put us in a financial mess. We're barely making it. So I couldn't' get a divorce if I wanted one, because I can't afford a lawyer.

And it seems like EVERYTHING is like that - I can't make more money without spending money I don't have to get a higher degree - which doesn't even guarantee a job. I can't get a divorce without spending money I don't have to do so. I can't afford a therapist because it's going to cost me money.

IOW, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - I'll only wind up deeper in the hole.

I'm not suicidal, and I don't want to make light of depression, but I am at the point where really, there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. But it's like, the only way I'll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and I can finally get rid of all of their trash. But what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we've fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we'll be paying until we're 90, or dead). If I go, well, I guess it won't be my problem anymore.

So I'm trapped again.

Getting out of the marriage - well, even if I could, there'd be child support that I couldn't afford.

So it's either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. Which is not really something I'm considering, so really, I'm trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. My spouse won't change. My child will probably become even worse with age. I'm just going to get more and more distant.

I've considered having an affair - but you know what - I'm not the type of person others are attracted to - I don't have any money so the shallow people aren't attracted to me, and I'd have to pay for a service like an affair site - which I know most aren't really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren't going to have people who are attracted to me becuase I'm the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. Plus, it costs money I don't have.

But you know, I'm not really interested in having an affair. At best it would just be something different to do. And I don't want to treat someone else like that. And I don't want to do that to my spouse. The only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.

I mean, it's almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it's almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.

Kind of like how America treats the majority of its citizens, but I digress. But yeah, the current national climate doesn't help with hope really.

My job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. But I see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...

And I can hear the advice now - that's not going to help.

Basically, my spouse needs to change and if they don't I need to get out. I know they're not going to change. I don't think it's right to give someone ultimatums - I think they need to come to the decision on their own. But it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. And at this point, I've done enough by myself without any support from my spouse I'm don't have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they're not going to accept that there's even anything wrong with what they're doing. I believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don‚Äôt feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can‚Äôt hear it), and sometimes I don‚Äôt make any facial expressions so people think that I don‚Äôt like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don‚Äôt want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like ‚Äúdo it, stab them in the neck‚Äù or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can‚Äôt put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can‚Äôt remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.

"I finished high school in 2013 when I was 18. I‚Äôm 22 now and I‚Äôve been kicked out of two universities. I haven‚Äôt worked, or accomplished anything. Everything that I tried, I failed. I feel like ever since 2013 all I‚Äôve done is grow older and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a little under 3 hours till midnight here(start of New Years 2018) and I just feel like 2017 was just another year wasted. It‚Äôs a very scary place to be. As if time is slipping away and I keep falling further and further behind. 
Anyways, I know this was a little random. I just needed some place to let my thoughts out because they were eating me up on the inside. Thanks for listening. ",2,"kicked out of two universities, havenít accomplished anything, failed"
"I spend a week trying to organise plans, and everyone seems to go along with it. Then last night, two of them decide to go out clubbing and get wasted. They tell me they ""can't be fucked"" because they are hungover. I tell them it's all good but I'm still slightly annoyed they had to backpedal. Them leaving causes all my other friends to bail. 

Then 20 minutes ago I see both of them in my hometown one carrying a case of beer. I've texted them to no response. Ditched, again.

Fuck this. I feel like no one really wants to be friends with me for myself. Like all my so called friends take advantage of me. I'm the only one with a pool, so they come here and include me of course because they want to have access to it I assume.

This year was hell. I fucked up the end of high school, fucked up relationships with family and now I feel like I've got no friends. I've never been friends with a girl.

I feel worthless. I wish I could end it all but I'm too much of a pussy. Feeling like I just want to turn to drugs right now.",4,"Ditched again,no one really wants to be friends, friends take advantage, fucked up relationships with family, feel worthless, turn to drugs"

"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didn‚Äôt tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. We‚Äôre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
I‚Äôm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I‚Äôm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don‚Äôt think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.
The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die. ",1," Got bullied, Never had much friends, feel like a failure, just hate myself,"

"Depression functions in a way where our percieved ""rock bottom"" always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until  you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore. Soon people don't help your loneliness, compliments don't cure your disgust for yourself, and success doesn't cure your guilt. And the funny thing is, even that isn't rock bottom.

Fuck all of those stupid idiots who say it will get better, it only proves how fucking unaware they are to the logical decline that is the essence of depression.",5,"rock bottom ,getting lonelier, disgust for yourself"
"I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks.

Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. 

I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day.

I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. 

I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt.

My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world.

I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic.

There is more to this picture but i cant bothered explaining in further detail. The short version of this story is: im really fucking depressed. No motivation and beginning to think that i cant trust anyone and like everyone in my life thinks that they are better than me.

"I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great. I can take steroids and a few other drugs to halt the progress, but eventually, it's gonna destroy my stomach/GI tract. I might make it to 70, but that's not really realistic. All I know is that my life is going to be painful. It already is, but long term, it's just gonna get worse. 

For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it? I'm never going to be able to live a normal life. What woman would ever want to date a guy who is gonna die in his 60's?

People seem to hold guidance and know what actions to take to achieve their goals (As if they have some sort of internal compass) I am completely lost as to this? What am I doing WRONG in life? It's also possible that I have a rare genetic disease (Which is being looked into) that causes atypical mental functioning, Is there any hope or should I just fucking end it? I'm so done now.

"I'll just try to make it short (and fail trying) My problem isn't worth really mentioning, I'm a privileged little shit that doesn't have it nearly as bad as most folks here, I even have a supporting girlfriend from a long distance who is also very anxious and depressed. But it helps a little to write it out somewhere. I've graduated from high school around nearly 3 years ago at this point. I'm 20 years old, highly anxious and I've always felt like a dissapointment to my family in every single way imaginable. I barely passed high school, and I hated myself for falling behind and ever since then it's been going down hill with me feeling like a piece of shit for not being where everyone else is. I didn't apply for any colleges right after high school, I didn't make any plans, for some reason I felt like my life was going to be over after high school. I was never thinking about the future but more so the next day. I put off working for quite some time. The thought of standing there socializing or handling money gets my nerves all riled up so I put it off. My parents weren't gonna pay or help pay for a local college so I was kinda stuck here just deciding to do nothing. I don't know why but it just felt pointless. I don't know what I wanna do for the rest of my life, I don't know if what I wanna do is gonna matter. I'm still gonna be a piece of shit that always makes the wrong choices so what's the point? I don't know it sounds pathetic but I don't know.

I lost most of my friends in this time frame, mostly because I cut contact with them because I was so ashamed of myself for doing nothing even though I had all the means to do something while they were going to school and doing what they were supposed to do. I was running out of excuses as to why I'm not doing anything. So two years go by like this, I numb myself with video games and don't answer any calls. I sit in my room all day every day and do nothing and try not to think about it. Sorry this is all over the place, there was someone I met that I unwillingly became friends with but ended up breaking the friendship with her sometime after her mother died. That left me feeling like a selfish piece of shit for quite some time, to fake being a friend. Also left me feeling incredibly guilty because said person needed support after her mother passed and I was just sitting here being a dick. 

I don't know. I can't get myself to do anything worth while. I get overwhelmed easily and I don't have the energy to jump start everything. The future looks so bleak and empty. Like fuck I can't imagine being 30 years old and still in this position. With each passing day I do nothing, the more I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know where to start. I get too anxious undergoing basic social interactions, getting a haircut feels like a nightmare since I'm infront of so many people and I'm absolutely petrified of running into the people I isolated from. I don't know, I've given myself ultimatums in the past. Last year I told myself if nothing changed by the end of the year then I'd have to go to the military but I didn't end up doing that. I'm just tired of it. It's like an endless cycle. I go out there, try to do something  realize I won't be able to stop working for the rest of my life and have to face the responsibilities of being an adult with so much social interaction and painful weeks. Or I do nothing about it, stay at home and don't be an adult and hate myself over doing nothing about my current situation. It felt good back then having a due date. With the military option back in 2016 it atleast made me feel at ease that I could die if things got too bad. Feels like I'm backing myself into a wall here. I can't do another year of this. I can't turn 21 and still not change, I feel like I'm gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Nothing I do is ever gonna have any kind of meaning either. It's getting harder and harder to find a good reason to live if not for other people. It's not going to get better I'm not gonna change because deep down all my problems come from me and I can't not be me. So it's fucked, I'm what's wrong with my life.

I wish things were halfway as easy as neurotypical people think. 

All people see when they look at me is a lazy failure. Most days that's all I believe about myself. 

I think when people say they want to help and support people who struggle with mental illness and disorders, what they really want is for us to shut up and quietly suffer so they don't have to think about it or see it anymore. 

I talked to a counselor at my university the other day. She didn't pay attention to a single thing I said and only wanted to verify that I wouldn't kill myself.

We used to be friends for a long time but lately all he wants to talk about it either sex, or the whole ""hey don't cut yourself, there's people who care, kisses!"". Everytime he talks about us hanging out it's about sex, or doing something sexual, and then when we do hang out that's also all he wants to do, and I just feel like he doesn't want to be in a relationship or he even actually likes me, he just wants sex and I'm easy. The rest the time it's like our conversations are some copy pasta crap about how you shouldn't cut or kill yourself. Like it used to be different we used to have actual conversations and now it seems unless there's another person there our real conversations are far and few between. 

Then there's my 'friends' who play games with me online. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason we even talk. I suck ass at fps so half the time I just make the game worse and honestly I can not fathom a single reason why they want be around, even my commentary is just me being annyoing as fuck while I let every one down. I think they just don't want to play alone, because that seems like the only reason I ever get invited to play and honestly I don't blame any of them. Or because they don't want me to kill myself, because the two that invite me to play the most are the two that know.

I seriously just want to kill myself, I honestly think it will be better for everyone, people wouldn't have to pretend to like me, they wouldn't have to suffer through be annoying them, it would be great for me too since I just hate myself so much because I'm such a fucking shit head. But I won't, because I'm a fucking pussy and I won't do it until I get the courage to do it again, and this time I won't fuck it up

"A crisp white coating engulfed the road at 5am. Another sleepless night, another crunchy step taken on the path to escape. It's like a deathbed, cold yet in a way comforting. 

The dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle. A cruel metaphor of life. Trapping once beautiful souls, emptying them, and leaving nothing but a mere skeleton. 

A real world dementor. Intercepting excitement during the most joyous time of the year. Holiday spirit flows through the air but all you can feel is the dark aura you are confronted with. 

Yet somehow I'm coming to accept that it's okay. A newfound serenity in an alternate state. One where my writing has meaning again, a true reflection. 

All this sounds more beautiful in my head. Like a poetic verse that captures the slight feelings I still have within me. The written words that fill the void of those that can no longer be spoken. ",5,"sleepless night, deathbed, the void"
"Hello..

I've been in a bad way for over 5 years as of today and tried almost every anti depressant but none of them help. I see a therapist and that helps a little having someone to talk to.. but doesn't really fix anything. 

I really try to be happy I exercise I got a job I was good at 

Well recently I got fired for ""Not being a good fit anymore"" or ""You seem really down and its bad in the work place"" 

I've turned to cocaine witch atleast makes me feel happy for 30 minutes before I feel like shit again 

I'm not a heavy user but it honestly seems like drugs are the only thing that really help and I know that sounds crazy.. 

My family has given up on my bullshit and I dont blame them I get really sad and upset over nothing and without a job I have just become a burden. 

I have tried to kill myself 2 times and I really reallly don't want to get to that point again but I just really need advice on what to do. 

I have stopped taking drugs for just over 3 months now to see if that was making it worse but it wasnt

"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony I‚Äôve experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I can‚Äôt describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the ‚Äúpain‚Äù is so terrible. 

I can‚Äôt escape him. I can‚Äôt escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I don‚Äôt do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him ‚Äúthis long‚Äù to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe I‚Äôll get numb to the point where it‚Äôll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. There‚Äôs nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I can‚Äôt get it. And I‚Äôm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didn‚Äôt. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts I‚Äôve made to get people to notice I‚Äôm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know that‚Äôs not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive.

"I know this sort of post isn‚Äôt original or whatever but here it is. 

It‚Äôs New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I don‚Äôt think I could care any less. 

I‚Äôm so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly I‚Äôm tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt. 

My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try there‚Äôs nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... that‚Äôs something else entirely. I know she‚Äôs not happy. I know she‚Äôd rather not be with me. She‚Äôs been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I don‚Äôt want to put her through this. 

But the issue is I can‚Äôt ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time I‚Äôm not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I can‚Äôt win. I really can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. We‚Äôre destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that?

"I don't know how to preface this. I guess, maybe, that I don't understand, and I am not understood. This is really shameless of me, to post. But here goes nothing.

Isolation plagues me, like, cancer plagues a person. I'm not comparing the grimness, cancer is terrible. But, I am comparing, how it's impossible to truly get rid of. Or at the very least, very very hard.

You see, communication, to me, is like trying to draw. In what way? Well, imagine you're drawing a wolf, but you're not good at drawing. So you think of a design, and in your head it works out, it looks amazing! Then, as soon as you go to put it on paper, it all falls apart and you end up crumpling the paper and trashing it.

Imagine, like that, but with vocal conversation. This is like, a giant wall, between me and anyone else. Nobody can get close to me. I can't get close to anyone. Nobody can even see me. I'm like a radio station broadcasting into the abyss.

*That's just who I am.* Nothing will fix that. So, I'm doomed, to loneliness and isolation. So is the way of life.

Not many people know what it's like to be that isolated. To be an alien among humans, to be, what seems like, the last of your kind. Everyone rejects you, because it's clear, you're not human. Your movements, the way you compose yourself, people can *JUST TELL*. And they avoid you. It's terrible, people get mad at you, scapegoat you, and you can't defend yourself on your own.

Since I was born, this is how it's been. The terror of a nightmare I once had, has slowly become an everyday thing. I'll attempt to explain the nightmare.

Here it goes : I was walking down a hallway. I was hit by sadness, isolation, stress. Not unusual. But then someone says something that throws me over the edge. I want to scream. I try to scream. I'm screaming. But there is no sound. I try to punch everything around me, and every punch lands featherlight, as if there was no intent behind it. I can't blow off anything, it's just fuming inside of me. I collapse hysterically crying(yet, not making a sound, even if I tried) and i awake with wet eyes.

It's the most terrifying nightmare I've ever had, yet, eerily reminiscent and metaphorical of exactly how I feel. Voiceless... It's so bad, I can't explain the isolation, I can't explain the loneliness, being someone so cold, yet, with so much to share, but you can't share it, and nobody will share with you. It's not fun, it's terrible, it's so bad and it's not something that can be fixed. It consumes me every single day.

It's not *just* the depression speaking. Legitimately, I have no chance of ever properly communicating. Do you know how that feels? Does anyone know how that feels? I'm sure they do, but that doesn't make it easier.

It's a stabbing pain, when, even people you've grown up with your whole life, you're not connected with. My mother means literally nothing to me. Nobody means anything to me, and I WISH THEY DID. God, I WISH THEY DID. It's hardddd though, I can't explain it. I'm trapped in a bunker nobody can penetrate. Nobody even knows I'm in here, so why would they try? They just assume that I am the cold, heartless, stone walls that encase me.

I could never explain it. That's what hurts so bad. The headaches, the pain. It's unbearable. I frequently dream about just shooting up a ludicrous amount of heroin and drifting into an endless sleep.

I don't want to live anymore, I want to be on the moon, where I belong. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be there soon. And I'll be sad for never.

Everyone has a sense of loneliness at some point, a yearning for belonging. For me, these are two facts of life, not temporary situations, just due to who I am. That's what hurts the most. Even if I  wanted something different, and I DO I DO, I could never fucking have it. It's so bad, its terrible, it's undefeatable.

It's not just a temporary state. Don't tell me ""it'll pass"". No it fucking won't, I'm not just saying that. It literally won't pass. It's not ""The depression speaking"". It is *LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SHRED OF WHO I AM*. And nobody, will ever try to break through those grim walls. I'm just an emotionless enigma to them, people just accept it. I want to leave this lonely place. But I can't. It's a curse, an everlasting curse I will carry to the grave.

"This past month has hit me like a freight train with red-hot spikes on the front. 

A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.

We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.",3,"break up with me, without love, life is shit ,Life in general is terrible, autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder, hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, don't think I can handle it much longer"

"I'm a 20 year-old female. I've been having depression for the last 5 years, with a peak in my 15-16. I used to cut myself, but then my parents found out about it and, seeing their horrified expression and how they handled it, I promised not to do it again. They helped me out though. I finished college and got into university, but still I was pretty depressed and had a few guys in my romantic life. Last year I met this wonderful guy who is my actual boyfriend. He's loving, caring, sweet and very in love with me. I couldn't really ask for more: i have a family, I'm pretty good at uni, have a boyfriend and everything. But still, my demons keep haunting me. I know it sounds horrible to say, but I really wish I was dead. I don't know, I see the bad in everything: i hate myself, i don't like my body even though many boys told me i'm beautiful, i wanna cut again, i hate how i am, my voice, my hands, my legs, my hair, my shyness, my behaviuor, my life. But I can't take it away, since this many people love me.. And I feel bad just by imagining how harsh it'd be for them to know about my death.
I can't cope with these thoughts that seem only to get stronger lately, I feel it even more when I'm stressed and the minimum stupid bad thing that happens or that is said to me makes me suicidal. Like really, I'd really want to jump off somewhere really high.
I can't go to a psychiatrist, since I hate being a burden to anyone. My parents, at the time, suggested me to go to a psychologist, but i didn't want to, because I feel like a burden (economically too) and my mum would have taken every chance to face it to me (like: wow, here talks the crazy girl). So yeah. I seriously don't know what to do, talking about it to someone isn't a good idea to me since my boyfriend thinks I'm out of this, my best friend is now seeing a girl and likes her and i don't wanna ruin it, and then I don't have any other friends. i think I wouldn't wanna talk to anyone in any case actually.

"Hello,

I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends.

Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. 

I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't.

It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted.

I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there.

tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen?

I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again.

Sorry if this post is a bit everywhere. I have Dyspraxia and what might make sense in my head might not make sense in yours. I hope I've explained myself well enough. 

Happy New Year.

"I'm a 20 year old college student guy who's never had a relationship before. Not even a kiss or held a girl's hand before. No one has ever shown interest in me before and I put myself out there online and irl. Tinder and OKCupid are dead ends, I've been on 9 first dates and 0 second dates, not to mention barely any matches on either. I'm not even being creepy, desperate, or too forward on them either, I'm just being myself. 

I often ask if people on reddit would be willing to go out with me HYPOTHETICALLY if I asked them out. Most said 'no' because I'm not their type, which I mean again, indicates that I'm no one's type. I mean, what can I do then? Am I really datable and boyfriend material?

I try to work on myself as much as I can, I go to the gym consistently and I'm in decent shape, try to take care of my appearance and dress nicely, get good grades in my classes, have a high-paying internship that pays more than some full-time college grads. I try to put myself out there and try different hobbies but I also shelter myself a little with video games. But overall, is that not enough?

People say that I'm not ugly but what does that mean? Are people blowing smoke up my ass? People say I'm just average-looking, which means that if I didn't try to put in effort, I would be ugly. I'm only average-height too, which kinda sucks. Here's me: https://imgur.com/a/6j6Zc

"Every day since we first met for the last 3 years K. has been on my mind. Where ""we clicked"" sounds cliche, sometimes its the only describeable phrase. We talked constantly. If there was free time in the day we wanted to spend time with one another until it was way past time for bed. I had dated only a few women before but with K. I could feel something special. We had a connection, a way of talking about anything that felt so genuine. So unique. Needless to say I loved K., more than I ever thought possible it was to love someone at all. I would to anything for her. I wanted to do **everything** for her. My life felt so complete now that I had someone to share it with, and that made me the happiest I'd ever been. This, surely, was love. Being so devoted to someone and having them feel the same about you. I'd been hurt before but K. made me feel like I could trust again. I felt we were strong together. Several times I would have to leave for weeks or months, and when coming back it felt like we just hit play after having been on pause. 


Every day since K. confessed to an affair she's been on my mind. I didnt think it was possible to hurt so terribly bad. The pain is my heart is physical, the agony is inside me. I never healed from the previous ex that had cheated and I have no hope to heal from this. So much time spent building something beautiful and within an instant it was abandonded. All I want to do is sleep but my dreams are about her. The moment I wake up I remember K. is no longer in my life and dread washes over me. All day long I feel sick. I've lost my appetite, nothing interests me anymore. After spending so long with someone they become a part of who you are and everything around you. Every object or event that happens in your life is related to that person. My life is on pause forever.

"So in the past year i think i made a lot of progress forward, i got my own place, took control of everything in my life, found a new group of friends (i don't know how, i just did), reconnected with some old ones.

And finally i honestly felt like i built some proper confidence in my self (all the while keeping that dark side at bay).

New years rolls around, i spent most of NYE talking to a girl half of which was sober (a year ago, that was literally impossible), I've met her before through old friends, and honest to god i thought the my feelings toward her were basically love at first sight type deal, more i talk too her the more i like her....anyway so, whole night and i'm thinking maybe, just maybe i could start something with this girl (note, never had a girlfriend so this feeling is completely new and obviously terrible at signals, i interpreted everything as interest in me on her part.....).

Get to end of the night (at which point shes keen to grab couple more drinks elsewhere) and bang.......she rings her boyfriend.

Then changed her tone to ""i should probably head home"" and bailed (no doubt there were other hints and signals i just didn't get or pickup on, cause i suck at that, so i guess most of this is my own fault), and now, after walking the dark streets for a better part of an hour, im home, alone and feeling just utterly terrible, hating my self for being so blind too it all and worst part, i thought i really had found someone amazing on my birthday of all days......

This new years will be a little different though. I'll be spending it thinking about a very special someone. Two years ago, I was attending community college. I had started in 2013, and told myself that I would bust my butt off and turn my life around. I wanted to make a change, and get out of the depressing rut I was in (as many of us here can probably relate). I remember coming across so many articles about depression, and basically came to the conclusion that the only way out was to fill my life with ""positive things"" and have some aspiration. And for 3 years straight, that's exactly what I did. I know this might not sound like a very big deal, since its just community college, but I did manage to Ace every class, always studying like their was no tomorrow, and remaining completely goal orientated. The dean herself actually sent me a letter congratulating me as being among the the top 3% in the entire school (its a fairly big campus). Even one of my professors suggested that I become a math tutor, and one year later that's exactly what I did. Not only did I now have a job and was doing well in school, but I was also well on my way to a top research university in my field of study. In my school, math tutors were assigned to the math lab, walk-in basis for free tutoring. One day a girl walked in and asked for some help with her homework. Naturally, I became completely head over heels for this girl. I don't want to bore you with the over-sentimental details, but I think I may be deeply in love with her. I can never stop thinking about her. It's gotten to the point where I honestly wish I had never transferred at all, just so I could talk with her over homework or something, anything. I miss her so much.

Wherever you are Gabby, I hope you're doing well and figure out what you want to do in life and become the best at it. I wish I could have brought you a bouquet of roses and tell you Happy Valentines. I love you so much and miss you everyday. I'll always love you.        ",4,"miss her so much, always love you"

"Hi everyone, first things first I hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and family

Moving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. 

I got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... 

It got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... 

But mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) 

So, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a ""way to thank him"" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. 

So he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...

Later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...

He left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. 

I started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. 

During that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and ""just"" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...

I don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...

I was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like ""thats what real friends do right?"". 

But between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple ""hello""  from me took weeks.

Like,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... 

I exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...

How? Just with simple ""memes"" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... 

What happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. 

The thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... 

Am I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only ""if""  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed

She is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... 

This is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :)

"I have had problems with anxiety since my previous relationship, mainly related to relationship anxieties. 

I met my girlfriend in the summer holidays and we dated until we went to university. Whilst at uni we decided not to do long distance but ended up facetiming every evening for hours on end, and basically carried on dating. 

I was really excited to see her again over the Christmas holidays and then the anxiety kicked up again. I think the long distance had enabled me to not realise it was a relationship until I got home and it hit me and suddenly the fear of making the same mistakes I did in the past relationship hit me. 

I went to the doctors and was placed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication and for the next week things were great again. But then the emotional numbness kicked in. I felt absolutely nothing for anyone or anything and it really got to me. Any feeling I did feel was just anxiety about the relationship. 

I want to get therapy about my relationship fears and I didn't feel like I couldn't do that whilst immersed in the fear, so I decided to break up with her so I could get help. I also stopped the anti-depressants because the numbness it made me feel caused me to self-harm which I've never done before. 

I'm so unbelievably sad. I love her, she's beautiful and kind and funny and I love spending time with her. I don't at all want to end it with her, yet I don't see how I could get help with the anxiety making everything feel like a mountain. 

I can't go back on it, I've hurt her too much by breaking up with her to say ""that pain was unnecessary because let's get back together"". And we agreed that if one of us broke up with the other then we wouldn't go back on it. 

I have this real hope that one day when I've addressed the fears I have that we can reconnect and try again but I know it's unfair on both of us to live with that expectation and hope.

This is pathetic and sad but, when I am not at university, I just eat and pretend like I‚Äôm going to go out when I never do. Sometimes I‚Äôll sit at a cafe and look like I have a lot going on, but the reality is I have nothing. I‚Äôm lucky to be able to have academic prospects but I‚Äôm only human and there needs to be a balance which in my life, there isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care anymore and I‚Äôve made an enemy of everyone I used to know. I look at people like disgusting aliens who I can‚Äôt relate to and whenever I‚Äôm out, I HAVE to be back at home. 

I haven‚Äôt had a productive day in years, and it seems like I‚Äôll never shake this feeling and my thoughts about the world. I really mean this : I HATE life, my life specifically. Nothing makes me happy like it used to. What amazes me are those people who can get a thrill out of a TV show, or a walk in the park or people with tons of plans and friends, or anyone who says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy‚Äù.

"and it is becoming difficult to stay focused. There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself.

I am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. 

This has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and ""bounce back"" or at least have an argument against these feelings. 

The hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. 

I want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation.

I have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing. It provides a sense of value to think what I say has an impact on myself or others.

"Perhaps I'm feeling maudlin because it's New Year's Eve, and this is the time we're supposed to look back over the previous year and try to make positive changes and take action to ensure the coming year is a better one. But I've been stuck in the same situation for so many years that I just can't bring myself to hope anymore for change, and right now I just feel worse than ever. I'll try to explain concisely, if I can. Apologies for the really long post, but I've held this in for a long time and I needed to get this off my chest.

I've known since forever that my parents haven't had the happiest of marriages. The biggest (and according to them, only) problem they have is my grandmother, my mom's mother-in-law. Now, I am given to understand that most in-laws don't have great relationships. With my mom and her MIL, things have been... horrible from the start. Her MIL (I don't like calling her my grandma, because she disowned me at birth and ignores and belittles me every chance she gets) has constantly tried to undermine her, badmouths her publicly (and in our society - Indian - reputation is everything), manipulates my dad by behaving like a sick, helpless woman in front of him (although she's the healthiest woman you could ever meet, otherwise) and claiming she's been on her deathbed for the last 25 years, makes caustic comments about my brother and I, and tries to provoke fights between my parents as often as she can in the hopes of breaking them up. These are incidents that I have seen occur myself, not things that my parents ever told me. They've avoided talking about this directly with me, perhaps fearing that they were forcing me to believe one of them over the other/influencing my beliefs in some fashion. But I could see these things happening, even if I wasn't old enough to quite understand them for a while.

My parents filed for divorce when I was a year old, but somehow they managed to reconcile, with the outcome being that my mom was forced to give up her job and her dreams of studying further to look after me because of course her MIL refused to.

Until my brother came along 8 years later, I remember things were pretty bad in the house; my dad wanted us to live together out of fear for his mother's health and not knowing what accusations or stories to believe, my mom hated the way she was being made to feel in the house and the way her actions were being lied about. Little incidents began being blown way out of proportion on both sides, there were some pretty huge fights. I lived with my mom's parents for a while (I love them, and have a deep bond with them). I wasn't a go-between for my parents, not then, but I knew I was still in the middle of their arguments. They wondered if the divorce would still have fallen through if I had not existed. But I knew they both loved me more than anything, and that was all that mattered.

And then my brother came along - a somewhat late miracle. He's nine years younger than I am, and with him came a move to another city where the four of us could finally live together by ourselves, and things seemed to be better - at least on the surface. Another move, and things seemed to be looking up, because my parents only really ever fought about was this woman. I finished school, started college, was somewhat reasonably happy that my parents weren't fighting as much anymore. My priority became to make sure my brother knew a loving home, where our parents didn't just love us with all their heart but also loved each other.

Then this year, my dad had to move back to the original city we're from, and I didn't want that to happen. But it did. And now we're back to square one, seemingly, except square one looks a lot scarier now that I'm no longer blind to every little thing that angers them. My mother's going through menopause at the moment, but she's more of a physical slave to her MIL's more and more obscure household demands than ever. She's depressed because she doesn't see how much longer this can continue, this life that she isn't living for herself. My father's unable to understand why we can't all just get along and be one big happy family, but then again he's at work all day, and when he's home his mother behaves differently. For her part, my mom's MIL doesn't want to live with us; she thinks she has enough money to live alone, even though she claims she's too sick to even move on most days. My brother, thankfully, doesn't care about this ridiculous and unnecessary soap opera drama. That leaves me.

My parents now confide in me when I beg them for an explanation as to why they look so distressed and harried all the time. They've never badmouthed each other to me, but I can see more clearly now how unhappy this marriage has actually been, and how afraid they both are that the next 20 years will be the same muddled mess the last 20 have been. 

I wish I hadn't asked for explanations, and I feel guilty that I wish I were even more removed from it all than I already am. I'm on campus in another city for half the year, but whenever I come home it's to a negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere that makes sure my determination to be positive goes down the drain. I feel angry and ready to snap, too, even though I have no reason to be. I feel guilty for leaving my parents in this situation for half the year, and for enjoying myself even a bit when I'm out because I know how sad they often are back home. I just want this to be over. I want a solution to this problem. I find myself wishing my grandma would hurry up and die, and there's a dark thought I didn't think I'd be voicing out loud but here we are. If people I love, like my other grandma and my aunt, can die before their time surely people I dislike can also disappear. I know it's wrong to feel this way, and I tell myself to buck up and be normal whenever I'm depressed enough about the situation to think this.

It's not so bad as I'm making it out to be. There have been plenty of good moments - in their marriage, and certainly us kids have never once doubted how united they are in doing their best for us. But I want it to be like that *all the time*. I want that happy family life. I don't want this sadness, and I certainly don't want to be the one aware of the massive failure in communication that occurs very often. And then I think I'm wrong for feeling that way. Basically, I'm a huge mess.

**TL;DR** My mom's MIL is a horrible person, nothing will ever change, my parents are stuck in a vicious cycle that is making them - and me - miserable, and I don't know how I can get myself out of this funk.",4,"Divorce, get this off my chest, distressed, unhappy this marriage has been, negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere, huge mess"

"This is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don‚Äôt even know how to start this off. I‚Äôm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I‚Äôm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it‚Äôd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn‚Äôt enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I‚Äôm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to do it anymore.

I‚Äôm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I‚Äôm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It‚Äôs a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

I‚Äôm visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I‚Äôm staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn‚Äôt good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I‚Äôve really fucked it up now. She didn‚Äôt even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won‚Äôt go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just can‚Äôt get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month.

"I used to be very close with my cousin and felt very protective of him. However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States).

Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him).

This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police.

She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him).

I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him?

The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this?

___________________________________________________________

I've felt like total garbage emotionally/mentally (and physically) since around May of this year. I think what I'm feeling is a midlife crisis. I felt like my twenties were never going to end and when it hit me that they were about to, I felt a tremendous sense of time running out and started realizing some terrible truths. First, I'm in the exact same place I was when I was 20 in spite of many failed efforts to fix that. I started seeing signs of aging all of a sudden. But what really did me in was finally landing a full-time job and being ecstatic thinking that I could finally afford to live on my own and be independent instead of continuing to live with my lunatic parents. Then it hit me that I wouldn't even be able to afford to share rent with multiple roommates even on a full-time salary and that realization just broke me. I haven't recovered.

When I would fall into a depression before, I knew it would pass and I just waited it out. However, all these age-related things hitting me at once and feeling like I'm so far behind my peers and feeling like a colossal failure, it's the first time in my life that I've ever felt like I wouldn't be okay. For a while, my life was okay with moments of feeling awful. Now, feeling awful is the norm with fleeting moments of being okay.

Sometimes it's an overnight change. I'll be depressed for a week - crying every single day, that crushing feeling you get in your chest when you feel your worst, wanting nothing more than to die, researching suicide methods, etc. Then for a day or two, I'll be closer to normal or maybe even a little happy. Then something will set me off (like making a minor mistake, or sometimes nothing at all triggers it) and I fall right back down into that hole and become miserable again. I just feel like life will never get any better and I don't really want to stick around to see how much worse everything is going to get. I was freaking out so badly back in the summer that I gave myself godawful muscle pain in my back and ribs that was mistaken for a pulmonary embolism and I was sent to the ER. A $1500 hospital bill to pay when I make $10 an hour didn't really help me to feel better about my financial position.

Is it normal for depression to do this? To come in waves, but never truly get better? Or do I not even know how to be depressed correctly and I'm just being a crybaby and having a bunch of consecutive adult tantrums? I've lost my desire to do pretty much all my hobbies at this point and when I try to pick them back up, I just find them to be frustrating instead of enjoyable. I just think I'm good and truly done with everything, and knowing I'm too much of a wuss to actually kill myself just compounds those feelings of hopelessness.",5,"making a minor mistake, crushing feeling you get in your chest feelings, of hopelessnes,s fall right back down into that hole,become miserable again, garbage emotionally, mentally ,physically, midlife crisis, so far behind my peers,feeling like a colossal failure,"

"My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating.

I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience.

Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad.

So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? 

I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.

Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself.

That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't keep myself going for more than a week befor relapsing before going back to old ways.

My family has started to notice how mad and sad ive become but have no real suggestions. My parents continually push me towards the field that I have no desire to pursue. I know they mean well, they want me to able to live well within my means. I also know things would be much different growing up in their shoes moving from India to make a better life for themselves and our family. But with that being said, my family doesn't understand how important mental health is for someone. My father treats my mother like absolute crap nowadays, but my mother is too worried about Indian cultures and traditions to do anything about it. My father has always cared about us but my mother has been a different story and I see it killing my mother inside. Again wee are Christian Indians and while it's not unheard of, it is certainly looked down upon. The sad thing is my mother would rather be in this marriage then to live out her days alone. That type of mentality devastates me and I could never possibly resonate with me. Hey it's easy for me to say never being in a relationship but I hope this behaviour isn't condoned regardless. So how could I possibly tell them the extent of my depression?

My life has been set up for me to live a nice and comfortable existence. However, ive managed to fuck that up every possible way down this long road. Ive never thought about seriously ending it all, but the thought has come up on multiple occasions. I know my family would be heartbroken if they were to find out something like that happened, so I guess there's one reason to live. Haven't considered therapy or drugs until now but I'm probably going to go once the new year begins. All I'm seeking now is a road to happiness somehow.",4,"father treats my mother like absolute crap, dead end job, life feels like a sham, terrible financial decisions, spend money frivolously on entertainment and food, no resolve, willpower, masturbate way too frequently"

"Hey guys,

So yes to spend 2018 off i am crying alone in my bedroom thinking where did it all go wrong and nearly attempting suicide.

Ive been building up my depression for over 15 years... pretty much starting when my parents broke up. I always use to have anxiety feeling that would make my gut whirl following with bad events taken place in 15mins... this resulting in a massive ammount avoiding bad incidents and essentially hiding from them. 

Coming to the present i feel like i am slowly getting to the point where friends are harder to come by and my current friends are slowly moving on with their own lives and leaving me behind (i feel like this due to not being invited anywhere or left to the last minute it makes me feel like a total loser when i have to ask someone what theyre doing) i also dont have the courage to find a soulmate purely due to knowing where to look or how to approach someone.

Anyways i want to know of anyone else success stories on tackling depression for the first time as i strongly beleive ive been stuck in this cloud for months. Hoping to seek advice from a professional.

My main wave of depression kicks in when i feel like my soul has a purpose it is pretty clear due to when stimulating my brain with something exciting that makes me feel like a have a purpose (this could be a simple as talking to someone) and the moments after said event finishing and the sense of importance to my existing fading.

Im sorry if this doesnt make sense but i got to the point where i nearly killed my self driving home though i told myself i think its time that i depended on someone for a chance and that i dont need to hold onto all the pain.

This world is tough no matter who we are... there is a few user online this NYE anyone reading please dont give up even though it may appear close friends and family dont care about you/me but sadly this is the true power of depression and in most cases causing the mind to be clouded.

"Hey guys,

I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me.
I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. 

I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clich√©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me.

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didn‚Äôt even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasn‚Äôt reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I don‚Äôt think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasn‚Äôt able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

I lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.

I started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.

I am not suicidal. There is only one ‚Äúthing‚Äù that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this ‚Äúthing‚Äù happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.

So, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up.

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. 

A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more.

At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone.

So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me...

I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do. I might consider myself in a somewhat critical state of emotion right now, as I feel too sad to leave the house, or even my room. Please help me...

"Okay, so here is the entire situation.

Growing up my 24M brother was bullied horribly by his peers and even at home my Dad was like your typical Asian dad and would be strict with him as he did not get good grades.

My dad would often say that he did not care if my brother had serious health issues so long as he got good grades and never gave him any freedom be it being up late or getting up a bit late in the morning.

Hence I became his only source of comfort and he used to talk to me and make me laugh.

Now with me, I had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that I was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.

Now my brother when he was 16 and I was 13 came to me with a weird request. He said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.

He said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since I was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once I turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.

I flatly refused and said that I wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience HS life

That's it.

He stopped talking to me from that day and I never made that much of an effort.

After my first break up, I was asked out by the most popular by of HS who I later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.

I promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.

His says that ever since I started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that I had put my social life ar more than his comfort

He moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,

He has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,

My dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time job

He lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.

Now I THOUGHT once school life is over, He would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as before

BOY was I wrong.

He wants nothing to do with both me and my father, He says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.

He says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished I had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.

I thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. I could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.

HE SAYS he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL if and when he passes away.

Says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.

I do not know what to do as I was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. Do I cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand How I help him)

Also My dad too does not care and considers him a major failure",4,"SAYS he will never talk to me, forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50, not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL, wished for at least an elder sis or a younger brother, dad too does not care,considers him a major failure"

I'm 25, never had a girlfriend, never had a real job, don't work at all since July and barely leave home.


I meet with only 3 people, but I'm really unsure if they consider me a friend. I feel like a placeholder, second choice, we don't really do anything, usually only eat and or watch TV. Except maybe for 1 who invited me to home new year's eve party but I got too anxious about meeting new people, so I cancelled.


In general I avoid meeting new people, I don't know what to talk about, I never can come up with a new topic, and especially I don't have anything interesting to say about myself. Those people that I meet with, they don't converse. They either don't talk at all, or talk and talk. Those are the only ""conversations"" that don't make me nervous, when I feel that I'm not obliged to say anything, but if I got anything to say I can say it.


I joined a gym but I don't enjoy working out, and even more I don't feel comfortable around so many people. Sometimes I'm freaking out because I'm not sure if should I shake hand with someone, or say something. When I'm resting between sets I almost try to hide and not draw anyone.


I feel intimidated by eye contact, especially with girls. Now this may sound super-stupid but recently a cute girl at the gym said ""Hi, how are you"" to me, and I replied with ""hello"" and walked away a little. In like two seconds she's in front of me, smiling, looking to my eyes and goes again with ""How are you"". Of course, I got completely frozen for long enough to make her walk away, probably thinking that I'm some weird deaf retard. The most pathetic part about it is that was the closest thing to a date I had in 2017.


I think it's a safe bet that my biggest issue is social anxiety. General anxiety would be second, and third for, I think, mild depression, mostly loss of joy?


Other than that I don't like how I look, partially maybe because of low self esteem and - very, highly, probably - inferiority complex.


I took antidepressants and anxiolytics (and hypnotics) for very long, now I don't take any ADs at all, anxiolytics in low doses and only if I really feel the need.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that.

"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"I am terrified.

I am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. 

It is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.

My mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I don‚Äôt know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?

I am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, you‚Äôre stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so that‚Äôs what you do, and that‚Äôs of no use either.

So you‚Äôve become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You don‚Äôt want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesn‚Äôt compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.

You hear all the naive New-Agers say ‚Äújust go for it!‚Äù, ‚Äúcarpe diem‚Äù, ‚Äúyou only live once!‚Äù, ‚Äúyou always have the choice to be happy‚Äù ""you can always turn your life around""‚Ä¶ and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They don‚Äôt understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  I‚Äôm just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I don‚Äôt.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. 

It‚Äôs something that we experience that most people don‚Äôt. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   

Personally, I‚Äôm really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: ‚Äúlook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Don‚Äôt you fucking dare tell me I could have been more ‚Äúopen‚Äù, or ‚Äúloving‚Äù. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was none‚Äù.

So then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

I'm done. Tired of feeling paralyzed in my mind. Tried to cry due to the overwhelming feelings of shame, self loathing, anger and pure fucking unexplainable misery but again I'm not even allowed the privilege to alleviate and try to find resolution.

Not even going to try and kill myself as it is fleeting, each a failure and my life being the biggest. Been to all the therapists and doctors who all gave up on me as my mind is broken beyond repair and all I get now is the ""is does get better"" bullshit when it does absolutely nothing for me. I'm just so tired of everything now and im getting frequent waves of pure hatred for people in general which makes me just want to be someplace alone. I hate being around people as they all seem to shit rainbows and unicorns which highlights just how fucking miserable and alien I am. I feel so defeated like why do I have to put every ounce of effort to fake a smile and turn up to obligations such as work as society wants ""happy and self motivated individuals"" which is all a load of shit. I also cant comprehend how and why people are so naturally happy. Like it's almost New Year's Day and I can hear again such loud reminders of how the vast majority of people are normal and happy beyond belief reigning in on the new year when I'm sat alone in my room, had a breakdown wanted to kill myself again with new inventive methods as my previous ones have eluded me like my sanity and contentment towards life.

Again, why can't I just feel basic emotions? Why am I forced as this hollow, pathetic husk of a person and my mind being a shattered vessel lost miles down in a fucking  sea  somewhere when all ""normies"" around me are full of shits and giggles being so blissfully ignorant drinking and getting piss lit. Why can't I smile as I feel positive emotions or laugh at something funny  or even feel scared I could be chased by a crackhead or a clown or something. Nowadays there's nothing. I don't smile. I don't eat or sleep properly. NOTHING is worth doing all hobbies and shit I liked are a chore or a pass time now I'm just counting down the days and even this year has been this shittest and yet I'm still coming into terms how my attempts have left me alive and why I'm continuing. Why bother living if I'm not happy or content and I'm living in auto pilot. I dissassociate my way through life and I'm hitting 20 in 2 months.

"I'm not really expecting sympathy as I know what I did was wrong.  Note, this is going to be long lol.

So basically I've been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  We were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that I was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  This was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it I deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who I was.  

Now, this ""relationship"" lasted through November and December which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why I couldn't meet him since we both live in the same area.  He was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  He was everything that I wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  What made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.

Over time I just stopped sending him photos and he didn't care he thought I was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  I wanted to tell him badly but before I did I sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how I looked.  Obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  I was a wreak, and still am.

I told him I was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how I was such a good catfish.  To my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  This was going great.  **Until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  I showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  I was completely average to him, I was ""not too bad"".  He wanted to remain friends and so I did. 

The consequences?  Honestly, I think I've been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  This was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  Looking at his pictures kills me inside and I haven't talked to him for 2 days now.  I feel empty and alone.  The nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  I don't know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  I think I've fallen into depression; I feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  On top of this is other things like my joblessness.  I find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything I wanted to be.  I'm not sure if I should even still talk to him.  I find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  I know I can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.

This will be my first and last time catfishing.  I'm not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first ""breakup"", being called extremely average, or both.  Thanks for reading my rant if you're still here lol.  If you're the one I catfished, sorry again... I really wish to talk like we used to.  This is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that I had confessed after my Christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...

Ps.  For those who are confused, I'm a guy too.

"Maybe this will help someone or help me. I‚Äôm not quite sure. I‚Äôm a 24 m with three kids. I‚Äôm going to back up and let everyone understand.

  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and she‚Äôs an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl I‚Äôd been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didn‚Äôt understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) 
  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. I‚Äôd have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.
  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I should‚Äôve been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldn‚Äôt go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. 
  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldn‚Äôt afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24‚Äôs day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldn‚Äôt afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.
  Alright, so at this point you‚Äôre probably like damn it can‚Äôt get that bad. As Billie mays says, ‚Äúbut wait there‚Äôs more!!‚Äù Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. He‚Äôll yeah. So at this point I don‚Äôt have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since I‚Äôm making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me she‚Äôs pregnant.(oh god dude you haven‚Äôt learned your lesson.) ((I‚Äôm 23 at this time.)) 

  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.

  That‚Äôs nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, what‚Äôre the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they would‚Äôve taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as I‚Äôd only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. We‚Äôre up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldn‚Äôt make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so we‚Äôre going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. I‚Äôve been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still don‚Äôt make enough. I haven‚Äôt paid any debt off. I‚Äôm about 28 grand in debt. I‚Äôve had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didn‚Äôt have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. 

  Now we‚Äôre here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, I‚Äôve ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesn‚Äôt see is I‚Äôm holding on.. I‚Äôm afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. I‚Äôve lost motivation. I‚Äôve found god. I‚Äôve gained motivation. Spurts. I‚Äôm strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like I‚Äôm 45. Maybe 55 because I‚Äôm tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job I‚Äôll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said I‚Äôm strong not depressed. I can‚Äôt even afford healthcare. I make too much as a ‚Äúsingle guy‚Äù to get Medicaid or the food card. I can‚Äôt get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesn‚Äôt exist either.

However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits.

That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field.

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬† Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear.

"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

Thank you so much.",1," treats others,racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality,  treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism,discrimination"
"2017 

Started it jobless. Struggling with everything. I was becoming afraid to even leave my house. Fear and anxiety basically consumed me. 
Medications were basically ruining my life, even after switching, switching, switching. Every one I tried, gave me severe, unusual side effects. (let's stay off this topic, just this was my personal experience and rather not get into it)

Toxic home life, even though I got myself out of situations quick as could.. the new home would end up being toxic as well.
I went into debt trying to not be homeless. 
I disappeared a lot socially. Sleep a lot. Eat too little. Eat too much. That same old stuff.

But I kept going to therapy. Even if it took me several months to go back. Sorry I avoided you Sharon for almost a year, you are a wonderful therapist.
She told me not long ago, that she thought I didn't need therapy anymore.
I used to hate it. But I would go. I would end sessions by sitting in my car crying and trembling from letting myself be vulnerable. 

Slowly, it got better. Slowly, I got better. I'm still terrible at talking her advice, but we worked on a lot. I didn't want to end therapy, I said I still have lot more to work on. But looking back, I think she is right. I don't need it anymore, least for now. (though I do intend of doing check-up sessions here and there or when Im struggling lot more again)

I got a job at a nearby store that I loved and would frequent when I could. 
It changed my life working there. It's not anything special perhaps to most people, but I met the most wonderful coworkers and management that really, truly do care about you and try their best to work with you and your needs. 
I ended up being able to work a second job for seasonal, though they say they will probably keep me, and I didn't know how I was going to make it through the week working so much.
But I am glad I did. I'm able to live alone in a small rental mother-in-law home. I started to live here with a friend I had since 4th grade.
I know her true colors now, and after much fighting, she finally left and got all her stuff few days ago. Needless to say, I hope I never see her again. 

I'm on my own here now.

I got groceries for the first time in a long time on my own without any help.

I have a new bed to sleep in, no longer my old bed from childhood.

My bills for the month are paid for.

I'm doing well on paying my debt off, I'm keeping up. 

I have a great support group now. 

I actually have people I can truly call ""best friend"".

I have a cheerful, wonderful baby nephew that makes any day better.

I don't disappear months at a time now.


I want to cry from how relieved I am.

I think I can finally live not in fear anymore.

For the first time in my entire life at home, I woke up not wanting to hate myself

I woke up wanting to enjoy my day and it doesn't feel like I'm trying to just ""survive""

It's a weird feeling because I feel like I've been running all my life and Im so tired

I can relax and rest, I feel happy

I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy.

However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal.

But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room. I tell them that I can't control it, but they always say I'm just acting out. Like no, fuck off Debra why would anyone want to act like they're depressed?

"No native speaker, so sorry, if I made some mistakes.
So, I'm 16 right now. For few years my mental health was getting worse and worse. Always most people of my age were rejecting me when I tried to make friends with them, what made me really hateful person. Inside however I was disgusted by myself as I knew that only reason they are rejecting is fact that I'm somehow inferior to them.
It's not like everybody hated me, there were few people who proved to me, that they are my real friends, but I was spending most of my time alone. I was thinking a lot. World lost most of its colors to me. Everything was so senseless. I tried to do something with myself, for example I spend a lot of time working out, but nothing was working. I started cutting myself and I was thinking about killing myself more and more.
My whole life I think I've gathered around me 9 people who I was calling my ""friends"". Between them was this one girl, let's call her W. So about one year ago I've discovered that W is more important to me than other people. I tried spending more time with her and we grew close to each other.
One month ago I decided that if in three days nothing changes in my life I will kill myself. I knew no-one would cry about it, my parents for example never hid the fact, that they hate me.
In this time I had one really important conversation with W. Basically ther was one guy, let's call him J. She wanted him to be her boyfriend, but when he found out he started bullying her. He threw many insults at her, what really hurt. I should mention that she's from the broken family. She told me, that she doesn't have any will to live and she was planning to kill herself in the near future. I've said that day to her many things I've felt. I told her that she is most beautiful and inteligent I've ever met and J should be beaten to pulp for what he did. I think she felt better. Next day we were hanging out again and I asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed.
We are together for a month now. Existence still was painful to me, but she was my reason to live. I knew without her I will commit suicide. I love her.
Few days ago I asked her if she wants to spend New Year's Eve together. She said that she will be partying with some girls, so she didn't want me around.
AND RIGHT FUCKING NOW I'M LOOKING AT PICTURES OF HER PARTYING WITH J. WHAT THE FUCK. WHY IS THIS HAPPENIG TO ME",4,"she didn't want me around,mental health was getting worse and worse,parents, they hate me spending most of my time alone, what made me really hateful person"

"I have extremely high standards when it comes to soulmates and partners, in fact, I've such high standards, me being 20 years old 
 I never had a girlfriend, and yes, I am extremely good with people; I can tell almost immediately who's who just by looking at them and conversing for a few minutes, and no, I'm not socially awkward, nor do I have social anxiety. A few days ago I saw perhaps the most perfect, and the absolute ideal soulmate in a video on youtube I've ever seen in my lifetime, and no she isn't super-famous or super-rich or anything, she's a starter youtuber. If you know a thing called ""internal checklist"" that you have for the perfect partner to fit under, appearances, personal traits, perhaps manners, the way they dress, their ""own world"" etc, not only was mine fully filled, it also has extras, AND she's single. Sadly, this isn't a story with a happy ending. She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this long ramble, I'll try my best to recover and just, sort of move on, although I know that periodically I'll probably get dragged back to this person. *sigh*",4,"she hid everything from public, feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, best to recover"

"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from England where it's currently 00:06 and I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess I need to put my thoughts somewhere (like a diary of sorts.)
I've felt dreadful for about 3 years now, progressively getting worse to the point of hating every fibre of my being. I've never really spoken to anyone about my thoughts or feelings, so maybe I'm not depressed, maybe it's normal to feel like this, but something tells me it isn't.
However, I am not here for sympathy. I'm writing this because I intend to turn my life around in 2018, I want to lose weight, put more work into university, maybe pick up some hobbies and TRY to be more social. So I intend to return to this post in 3 months or 6 months or a year when I've hopefully managed to change my life for the better, and I hope YOU can do the same, whoever you are, wherever you are.

I hope you have a fantastic year, god bless you.

"My current situation is that I'm depressed, socially anxious and extremely lonely. 

I'm posting this in the hope dat Its something to talk about with someone. Maybe someone can pull me back to the ground. 

I've written thus pretty quickly so sorry for the typos in advance. 

Writing this story is actual the first one so I don't know what other perspectives there will be. But the first one will be the most realistic one. The one that's in my head and the one I'm currently living. No lies, no bullshit, no beautifying things. It's not a nice story, it's not a beautiful story. I hope it's written in a way you can follow, and I hope you enjoy it, I hope you can understand. And maybe this will never be seen by anyone other's eyes. 

The reason I'm writing this I because I want to get it out of me. For the first time I feel that I can actually change my thoughts. Maybe just maybe I can trust again. Maybe my thoughts of worthlessness and being the worst person can fade away. Maybe I need help. Maybe my dark and scaring thoughts can go away. Maybe someone will read this and can understand or maybe relate to this. Just maybe ... 
 

So let me take you back. Think of this boy 16 years old just moved, for the 3 time in 5 years. His mom was kind of his Idol. She was always there and she was able to keep me safe and protect me a little bit from my strict dad. 
Friends a had a few. I switched schools a few times so I didn't make a lot. Some were colleagues some work classmates. O and I mustn't forget, I had a girlfriend. She's my first girlfriend and she was a
2 year older then me. I don't think I really liked her that much, but for the first time someone liked me instead of falling for a girl that's way out of my league. So I stuck with her for a while. 

So almost immediately after we moved my parents started fighting. They did this before but not as much as they did now. The fights were different. They didn't had a subject, they were just fighting for the heck of it. My sisters, of which I have 2, didn't live with us anymore. They moved out and the youngest one only went back once every few weekends. They didn't notice it as much, but even they could tell something was wrong. 

After a few months my mom decided it was time to go to her parents, she would talk with them about my parents relation. On that moment I got back from work and my sister was back home as well. When we sat down, my dad's phone when off. He got a text from my mom, but it wasn't addressed to my dad. It said something as follows:

Hi dear, just talked to my parents, Hmm. Doesn't look that bright anymore. Probably won't take long any more, hmm. Miss you, love. 

This is all I remember off it and it's translated so it won't be 100% but you'll get the gist of it. And you'll also probably guess this wasn't supposed to go to my dad. It's was meant for someone else. My dad, sister and I all read the message, and could believe our eyes. What does this mean, what will happen now? 

At this point is was scared, no frightened. Frightened of the thought my parents would divorce. Frightened of the thought that I'm probably going to have to choose a side. Choose between the person you trusted with whole your life, but now seems can't be trusted and the person that was always strict. 
When my mom got back from her parents, she asked for my dad to come outside with her cause something went wrong and she had to explain her self. She told a very nice story. It's just how she and her colleagues texted with each other. For a second I wanted to believe that. I wanted it to be true,. But I knew it's probably not. This will be marked as the start of the divorce it thought to myself. 
My sister and I talked to her, she promised the didn't lie, that's she  old be trusted and she would never do such a thing. Yet again, I wanted to believe it so for then, I just accepted it, went upstairs and tried to sleep. 
Like I said this night would be marked as the start of the divorce, but it's also first thing I can recall what is damaging me I guess. After this night I can't remember a lot. It feels like my recordings have stopt for a few days / weeks. 
The next event I know, but I'm not totally sure where it fits in the time line, is coming downstairs on Sunday too see my sitting at the diner table, crying. Crying his heart out. Being broken by the months and months of arguing with my mom about nothing. He was devastated and didn't know what to do anymore. At that moment I didn't know what to do. I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt feel present at that moment. My sister was already up and she was talking to him. Trying to calm him down. 
Like I said I didn't k ow what to do. I wanted to hug him, but he always had seem to be arms length away from me. The thing I regret the most now about this, is that I was too scared of my own emotions to stay or to comfort my dad. I took my stuff and went to work. At work time stood still. It was comforting cause I  could clear my mind but also upsetting cause I wanted to go to my family. I wanted to know what was going on. I talked to my girlfriend who was working at the same place at the time. She didn't really help. She didn't have that much empathy and couldn't really listen to my story. When my shift ended I went home and that's the last I remember about it. 
At times I think the evening marked as the start was adjacent to the Sunday morning, but that just doesn't seems right. 

The last event before the divorce that I know is the most haze one. I only k ow a few things. I was up in my room, I wasn't alone. But I don't know if a friend was there or my girlfriend. My dad was at home. So it's probably a Saturday or Sunday. 
Suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me she packed a few things and is going away. I remember her asking me something. I don't know what. I belive it was either: do have anything to say go my? Or : would you care to join me? 
Either way I stayed in my room and that's the last I know of it. 
It turned out my dad had heard her over the phone, talking to a friend of hers, saying ""I know it's wrong, but when ever I hear his voice, it's like falling in love again"". This is when my dad said she should pack a back and go. 

Soon after this broke up with my girlfriend, the fact that I didn't really like her that much and I didn't fell that well and she could help me pushed me over the ledge to do it. 

So when my mom got out of the house she stayed a few weeks in her colleagues home. He didn't life there cause he just moved in with his girlfriend I believe, but I'm not sure. Our dad forced us a couple of times to get over there. Talk to to her, he always said ""don't forget, she's still your mother"". 
I found it extremely difficult, just talking to her, she broke my trust, She made my dad cry.  I didn't k know what for say but the fact that I was disappointed or even discussed by her mad when feel bad. And I wanted her to feel bad. I wanted her to feel the worst of us all. She'd deserved that. I deserved that, but she didn't. Or maybe she did but she never showed after that one night. 

Within a year she told us she had met someone else. When we asked of he was this person she meant to text during the first event. She promised us this is someone else. An old friend. It was my dad's best friend, at least I believe he was. They even had a certificate about it, and they both had it hanging in the hall way. 

After she promised, after we started to believe we found out he was that person all along. It also turned out that my mom talked and went to him even before the whole arguing started. Phone records showed everything she did and for how long it went on. Even showing this she held on to her lie. This is the hardest part of trusting someone, trust in someone is as strong as they are believable. my mom, not so much. 
After a while I found a girl, who was amazing. I thought she was beautiful. From the moment I first layed eyes on her I though, damn this is something else. 
And she was. It took me some time to persuade her. She first wanted to stay friends and such. The  she fooled around with someone else. That was the first time she hurt me actually. She lied about that. Maybe that was some kind of sign, maybe not. After that I tried again  and succeeded. She was officially my girlfriend and I've never felt better at that point. 
We did a lot together but not everything. So we had space to our self. She was needy though, but not too much. After being together for almost a year I decided to move. I wanted to stay in dorms close to my school, and so I died. At first the didn't like that. She wanted to keep me close. But I couldn't stand the traveling for 3-4 hours a day. Eventually the was OK with that. 
After half a year she went studying as well. She learned new people and I was very happy about it. She would get more grown up and that's what is was hoping for her. But, as she said afterwards, she got bored with me. But she didn't want to break up. I thought everything was still OK. When the next event happend. 
She wanted me to come with her to church for Christmas. You must understand, I've never been to a church before. At least not as a not tourism thing. So after a few I thought we'll off course, for her I will. 
So I went with her and her family. And I think it was one of the worst things I've been too. Like the priester would got on and on about how people should live more closely to the Bible. People didn't respect it as much. And I was sitting there, not even red a bible, not even a few words. 
Afterwards there was no thank you from her. She didn't look amused. So later that day after dinner I asked what was going on. We took a walk and then she said she wanted to break up. She didn't had explanation. She just wanted to be single. 
I was devastated, didn't see it coming. I was high up there and suddenly everything was pulled away underneath me. Most of you will probably know how it's feels to be dumped without knowing it was coming. 
I asked her if there was someone else. She promised there wasn't, but off course there was. There was this guy is her class I hadn't heard a lot about him, but I knew who he was. I found out because she was still logged in on my pc and saw all her recent chats. 
Again the trust in someone completely shattered. But I was still head over heels. So I kept trying. 4 months later we started dating again, but there was no trust. I doubted everything she would say I didnt believe a word she would say. 
Its hard to life like this. And I've seen some dark sides of my self that I hope never have to see again. This lasted almost a year then she wanted to go to her father in South Africa. And that's when I said we should break up. This isn't going to work. At this time it was mutual, but trust didn't restore. 

A year later I got a girlfriend again  it was fun at all, but I believe I wasn't in love with her. 

After a while my oldest sister would drop her contact what she had with our mom. She didn't want to hear anything about it anymore. To be honest, I don't know what the last straw was. I do remember her arguing in the car, and me waiting on the outside till she was done. 

My connection to my mother is nihil. Almost absent, she never apologized to me personally and never asks why I never call or something. It's like she's not bothered by the fact that she feel like an aunt or even a distant relative. When the divorce happened there was this big drama about money possession and such. 
My dad was crazy enough to pay for her motorcycle license. I don't know ow anymore why this happens, but it did. My mother didn't want to help my dad with keeping the household running. He was paying the mortgage on its own and even provided everything for me. He could barely come around. The hard part for me was that she didn't want the help my dad, knowing he was providing for me. That's how much I'm worth to my mother I guess. The though nothing more. This one stings, and is one that keeps on getting back. 

When I broke up with my second girlfriend one of my friends hurt me like damn hard. I was close to him, he was a very good friend of my. I losend a little bit. Did talk a bit about my parents, just barley. When his birthday came around he didn't invite me to come over or anything. Apparently was the brother of my ex more important he got to go, I had to hear from someone else. I'd expected that he'd atleast let me know, but nothing. After I asked he said that I would maybe had a hard time with it. Him not even asking was kinda a slap in my face and I left it at that. I'm not saying this is his fault but this adds up to the pile of things I can't seem to process. Now you might think this isnt that big of a deal, but only having 4 real friends, missing one is hard. 

And soon enough after graduating the other friends faded as well. The current count is 1 and I don't anyway how I can get that number up anymore. 

Work is the only positive in my life though. I'm good at it. Colleagues look up to me and it comes easy to me. There is also this one colleague. I was very close with her. Told here some dark thoughts. She seemed to listen, so at one point I tried. I tried to reach out but it didn't work. I told her I'm in a hole and can't get out. I told her the I don't see anything positive about even being here. She listened and listened. Afterwards she said  what about this other colleague? Can't you talk with him also? And didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks. Not even the question, jeez how are you doing? Are you as OK as that smile your putting on? This really hurts because I was kinda hoping we could have been friends. But all that I'm for her is a colleague, and never will be more. 
This time I reached out, it took so much energy. Months after it happened I 'woke up' again. Can't recall any that happened in that period. I know that I was done and decided I needed a change. 
I decided I'd go to China for a few weeks, went there, and life felt great. I was able to make friends. To myself I looked social again. For a few week my dark side could near me. 
I was sleeping in hostels and contact with people was so easy and fun to do. But this only lasted as long as my vacation lasted. Getting back was hard, after just a week I felt down again. Seeing her at work reminded me of everything I wanted but wasn't able to. The next month's are not recorded again. I was asleep. 

When I traveled to China I stopped in dubai. Here I met a girl. We met trough Tinder(I know right). But she is amazing. She always is there for me and really helped me out quite some times. The only bad thing, she isn't close. I can't just go to her, which in many many cases I wish I could. 

This not recording or sleeping is something is hard to explain. I don't know when I'm a sleep. I do know when I'm awake. When I'm awake if always feel like I want it to change. These are also the times I talk alot with the girl from dubai. I like to think she really understands me. She close enough I can open up, but lives far away, so I'm less scared she would breake my trust.

By now you might think, you had 4 friends 2 faded, one ended, where is this last friend in all of this. Why is he one of persons you talk to when you're awake, how comes he doesn't know. Well it's simple, for one he's to close. I don't need to show my trust if I don't let him see anything is wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm greatfull he is my friend, but I don't want to put trust in something I'm not sure off. He has this believe that state of mind is fully controlled by your self, if you don't want to feel it you'll not feel it and there won't be it. Take sadness for example, if you don't want to feel sad you'll not be sad if you don't let it. Quite strong character you can say, but it also makes that he has less feel for empathy. He won't ask because he doesn't wants to seround himself with bad feelings. And I belive he would see a cry out for help for what it really is. Can't blame him, I would steer away as well if I knew what was coming I guess. 

So by now you'll probably think that this isn't this hard and they are just things I need to process or just let it be because I can't influence anything of it. Maybe you're right, but try to see through my perspective. I'm having a serious trust issue and I'm withholding my self of being social with any one new, so it's kinda hard to process it on my own. 

So I talked about the whole social part. This is one of the things om not anymore. I feel like since I graduated I can't converse with anyone new. I find it hard to come up with questions to ask. It's hard because it always feels I'm not interesting enough for the other person. Plus it always feels my common knowledge is going as far as the most of them. Maybe this varies per location, or group of persons. I don't feel like this with my best friend, I do feel like it when someone new gets introduced to me or with anyone at work. The only one who doesn't bring up that feeling is the colleague I've spoken off before. 

The only thing that is left behind are my thoughts. My thoughts and I have been locked up with each other for quite some time now. And they do collide every now and then. Sometimes my thoughts wants everything to stop. And not just the thinking but just everything. Feeling nothing, being nothing. And the only nothing I know, is something I don't want. I still believe that there is something to stay for. My thoughts just think otherwise.

Please share your experiences.",2," no money , spend my days crying,don't want to be like this forever"
"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasn‚Äôt happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didn‚Äôt have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasn‚Äôt. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, I‚Äôm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If you‚Äôve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind.

"17 years old here.
Tl;dr: Have been ""clean"" of depression for about a year, depression came back, I write a list of things i want to achieve within the next 6 months, if I fail achieving all of the things I will commit suicide and give up forever.
Having had depressions since I was a child (always hated myself, was never satisfied with myself, even had suicidal thoughts at the age of 8, being sad and lazy, having no motivation for anything). Around 14 months ago I told myself I am gonna fight this, I will not let my life be controlled by this sickness. I completely started my life all over again. I fought my porn and alcohol addictions (I live in Germany, here it is no problem for people under 16 to have access to cheap alcohol). I got rid of toxic friends, started working out (a lot), changed my diet and got more social. I even got a bit into meditation. Focusing a lot more on important things like sports, school/education. I really got back on track and thought that I had beaten my depression completely.
After some time I finally felt true happiness. I found good friends with which i had a lot of fun and which i truely love. And it went on like this for actually a lot of time.
And then it all slowly crept up on me again...
I dont know why, I dont know when exactly...
About 2 months ago I started feeling inner changes. Doing things that usually would be extremely exciting to me did not bother me anyway, when I did them I did not feel any emotions at all (for example illegally climbing up a crane for the first time in my life; i did not feel fear while doing it or relief/happiness afterwards)
In general I just recognized some kind of neutrality towards life; i did not have any real emotions anymore. It became stronger with time. 
That is just how it started, a lot of events were since then (dont want to bother you with things that are not relevant/interesting, so i keep it short) like severe injury, finding a girlfriend, stress in general. And yesterday my whole life just flipped and the depression train got a full body hit on me. My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now and my family is mad.
I never thought that I would have depressions again but well there they are: crying, self hatred, suicidal thoughts, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden, not having eaten or drunk water for 2 days, not having washed or changed clothes for 3 days.
Well after a lot of thinking I came to a conclusion:
I will write a list of things I want to achieve until first of July 2018 (exactly half a year). If i achieve all of these things, fine. If not, I will commit suicide. And I take this dead seriously - If I cannot get my life back on track I do not see any reason in living anymore. I could do it once but it only helped temporarily. So if I cant even do it again, my life will be bullshit forever and i dont want that.
Luckily I am fucking afraid of death (which is good because that way I have never tried suicide but only had a lot of thoughts about them) so I have a lot of motivation to actually achieve all the things on the list. I DO NOT FUCKING WANT TO DIE so I really have a very good motivation, but if I fail I will overcome my fear, because I MUST die, there is no other rational option.
If anybody is interested what some of the points on my list are (i havent worked it out completely yet):
-130kg bench press as 1RM
-250kg deadlift as 1 RM (yes I am very sports focused)
- having an average grade of 1.5 or better (which is extremely good in the german school system)
- losing my virginity
- earning 1000‚Ç¨ with side jobs

These are hard goals, but with enough work I can achieve them and I will start out extremely dedicated and set a symbol. For the first week of 2018, so the next 7 days, I will close away my smart phone, not have any social interactions, working ALL day (learning a lot, reading a lot, starting meditation, working out, cooking amazing meals)
The only thing that concerns me is that propably some of my friends will not be able to accept my new strict form of living (and propably be mad that I didnt talk to them for 7 days without warning them before) but I have no problem with making sacrifices like those to earn my right of surviving.",4,"My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now, my family is mad,  toxic friends,self hatred, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden,"
"names where changed and the grammer problems are because of a reading problem i have but try to read it to your best abilities 



I was born from a 15 year old mom and a 20 something year old rapist dad yeah starting even before my birth shit was messed up, when I was born it was april 22 2002 in berlin vermont surprisingly it was cold in april snowing even. So lets move to one of my first memories one day when me and my mom lived in a trailer park someone slammed a door and a glass painting fell and it went through my foot. Later in my life me and a step brother of mine where fighting and I fell through a glass table causing glass to go through my skull causing more pain from an early age.
 So later in my life my mom began to date a man named dan he as a cook in south carolina so when we move there I had my first experience in a long line of male role models due to the fact that I had no dad growing up or a consultant father figure so I developed a distain towards them but not till the second one. So my mom had a bad case of ptsd and probably bipolar disorder cause she would change from happy to pissed on the matter of seconds and this would often be in many of my memories.
 After one big fight between mom and dan they broke up and I was sen to live with my grandma but she left me with someone else till I was 6 when after that mom and dan got back together and I moved to live with them in florida. We lived in an apartment building and me and dan began to develop a father son relationship he was nice to me and taught me how to read better and build with legos and was overall an awesome guy ( at least what I can remember) but all good things must come to an end around age 9 mom and  dan broke up and me and mom moved to vermont once again. 
During the time we are we moved back me and mom lived with friends and family for a short amount of time till we became homeless for a good amount of time during the winter. And it had a major effect on me academically and emotionally. I began to develop a reading disorder and Oppositional defiant disorder which caused me to not to develop any kinds of friendship and social ties only loneliness it got to a point where the other kids saw me a scary and unstable and the school thought it was a good idea to lock me in a small room alone with only a desk and a chair and a packet of work for 7 hours a day. I became isolated and depressed at 11 at 11 years old I began to think I was not deserving to live on this world. But something around this time changed in me the boy who once saw the world ash happy and okay had changed in to a semi sociathinc ball of emotions of sadness and anger to a point where life was bland and grey.
I felt alone completely and in honestly around this time my reading disability went away but my o.c.d went away but I still was depressed and sad.mom was busy but always made time to give me affection and strict guidelines and I wished I could feel the joy of my adolescence in these times but no it was nothing but dark.
 on day after a teacher yelled at me for my different actions in the school compared to the other children I decided to act the way they wanted me to be I smiled and laughed and spoked and behaved but it was just a mask I wore so the real me would die alone in his ball of emotions, but he didn't after a solid year of wearing a mask of happy I began to convince the other people around me that I had changed  and it worked I was let out of the room and made friends with the other kids, and it almost fooled me into thinking I was happy but no I could tell that no matter how I acted I can't hide how I felt inside. Later in my life I moved to ca with my mom and her new bf and he was a grade a asshole, he made me actually try to commit suicide and my mom finally found out when I decided to jump 3 stories of a balcony and she stopped me. But steve had done the one thing no other father figure had done he got my mom pregnant with my little sister bella and that is the one good thing he ever did in my eyes cause that baby was wonderful funny and overall an awesome addition to the family but all good things must come to an end.
Steve one night found a will I wrote cause I was scared he would hurt me and he locked me up in a padded room for 2 days and that cause my depression and loneliness to come back and fucked me over . when I got home he beat the shit out of me till I started to bleed from my skin, and with that my mom gave me a gift that I will never forget ‚Äúdo you want to go live with your nana, or stay here with me‚Äù and I love my mom I truly do because she is the one coinsastant thing in my life but I couldn't stay here with that jackass and I left so much out of the story because I don't have the time and the focus to recount the entire story but on that day I took 3 planes here and begun to live with my grandma. Do I regret it sometimes but overall I am happy and semi sad at times but I am okay here

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense.

"Hey all,

Normally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o ""sophomore"" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the ""play it safe"" route.

I just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.

I've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.

As far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these ""fine art"" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.

This past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like ""how to use microsoft office"" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.

Sorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, but I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting I obviously meant a lot to her, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like the best sunreddit to post this, but it does deal with two people who suffer from it and causes a lot of pain in their life even though the mail focus has been on the relationship. This sunreddit also seems the most supportive from others I have tried.

"Last night, I ended a relationship I had with someone that I'm very, very in love with. We can't be together now or anytime in the near future because of distance, and that was becoming unbearable. I started talking to another guy, someone I don't really know at all, and this is how I ruined what I had with the guy I love and I just miss him so much. I can't even talk to him anymore even though I desperately want to. I feel awful about hurting him and talking to him will make it worse no matter how much I wish I could.

I had a ""break up"" with a very close friend recently as well, someone who I share years worth of memories with and used to hang out with weekly. She posted a picture on her instagram story two days ago of her at a specific theme park (plans we had together) with someone else, and then yesterday she posted a picture of her with some new friends captioned ""best gifts of 2017"". My other friends think she is trying to make me jealous.

I live with my parents and my dad has been treating me like shit, today I literally thought he was going to kill me over an unwashed dish. I'm just tired of the abuse, I've gotten enough from him and my mom's ex bf combined. I don't understand what I did to deserve any of that but I guess it will always be beyond me.

On top of all this, I'm becoming very unmotivated in college and life in general, I'm afraid of not being successful in what I truly am passionate about, and I have no job (I quit because of anxiety) and need a new one soon because I'm going to run out of money. 

I feel like shit and like a terrible person, I can hardly eat and I've basically just been crying all day. I have no NYE plans (obviously) and I just hate my life so much. The guy I met recently wants to go out for coffee this upcoming week, and I agreed even though I feel hesitant. I'm just having trouble accepting that I can't physically be with the guy I love. I feel awful for what I've done.

tl;dr, I'm depressed and crying on NYE, almost everything in my life is currently shitty, I ruined something special I had with the person I love and wanted to be with more than anything and ultimately broke his heart

I see no solution to this problem. It's not like I can't feel anything, that's not it. It's more like every emotion I feel is flat and fake. I can be happy but it is an empty happiness. I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush.

Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least.

I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it.

I have one male friend who knows everything about me. I believe I'm not homosexual but I think about him a lot recently. It feels like he is someone who I would be able to feel affection towards. Even this would be better than nothing, I suppose.

"I'm going through a pretty rough breakup right now, and... I have no one, anymore. I have no one in my life now that I have lost my dove. And it's entirely my fault that I lost her. I fucked up, and now there's nothing left.

I have no idea why I'm doing this. I guess, I just wanted people to see. See some of my conversations with a therapist on trying to improve myself, and... my failing to do so. Just so I can show people that... I tried. This is the first conversation between my therapist and I, about three months ago. I guess you should know I'm pretty straightforward usually and... I'm also pretty fucked up. I was trying to become a better man, for myself... but mostly for her.


I don't know if this will actually interest anyone, but... Well, maybe someone will be kind enough to grant me some company or companionship right now... I am in a very, very dark place and... I would rather have died than to have lost that girl, even... even if we weren't really happy together. I took out the names because... well, the girl in question knows about my therapist, as it was her suggestion and all and.. Despite the fact she will never see this, I still don't want it to be recognized if she does.


 *Hello, &lt;//////&gt;. My name is &lt;/////&gt;. I guess I don't know where to start. Right now, the particular issue I'm having is that my insecurity has been the cause of every relationship I've had failing, and is ruining my current relationship. I have no idea how to stop it. I'm too needy, too clingy, unable to control my emotions at all. I am obsessive, and possessive. I am a hateful, spiteful, angry person and I have no idea how to let go of the things that have happened in the past. I want to change, but all anyone ever says is ""only you can do that"" and ""only you know how"" and that doesn't help. If it's all up to me, then it's hopeless.*


&gt; Hi ///// - Thanks you so much for reaching out and sharing so information about your experiences. My name is ////// ////// and I am a licensed therapist. Reaching out for help takes courage /////, you have made a wonderful first step toward creating the life you have always wanted. You talked about being really sensitive right now and how the way that you are feeling and responding to others is causing a great deal of distress. Based on the things you have shared, what you are feeling makes perfect sense. I have experience working with individuals who are interested in working through the barriers and unresolved issues in life to find a higher level of peace and joy. I would like the opportunity to help you this this time in your life. I would like for you to review my online schedule and select a day and time for us to have a live video session. This session would enable me to share the limits of confidentiality, review consent for therapy, explain what you can expect throughout the therapeutic process and answer any question you may have. Be encouraged, I think therapy might be a chance for a new beginning for you!! In the meantime, can you share more about how you have been dealing with all of the things you are experiencing? Who supports you in times like these?


*I have very few people that I have kept around me. I have no network of real friends, I have no support group. The majority of my emotional stability becomes the responsibility of the person I am romantically involved in, and this causes a great deal of stress to the both of us, and is generally an unhealthy way of handling things. I have only one or two true companions in my life, my closest and oldest of which I no longer get to see because he has moved far away and only visits rarely. Any occasional acquaintances I happen to make almost always end quickly, or never develope beyond anything other than a work mate or occasional social interaction. My family has either moved states away, or has so much drama and conflict that I do not feel it would be beneficial to bring them into my own.*

 *There are many worse things, though, that I feel probably ought to be brought to attention sooner or later. There have been many traumatic events I have experienced from childhood to adulthood that have left me a very isolated person. Even when there are people who try to reach out to me, I do not trust them with knowing most things, and do not want to burden them with my emotional issues. I am not an open person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD and Insomnia, and the last psychiatrist I saw I didn't spend enough time with to confirm but it is also suspected that I have manic depressive bi-polar disorder or another emotional instability illness based on the time I spent with them and the fact that most of my family has been diagnosed with MDBPD.*

 *As for how I've been dealing with it, I've tried many things over the years, most of which weren't beneficial. Drug and alcohol abuse was severe during particular periods of time. I cannot maintain hobbies or interests for any period of time that could be considered significant. Mostly I just lay in bed, being miserable. I do not have the energy, the focus, or the motivation to do anything. I never have.*

*Many people have told me to seek therapy in the past, but the only time I was ever actually involved in psychiatric evaluation was when I was around 17 or 18, still in high school. At least, that's the only ""adulthood"" memory I can account for. When I was younger, my brothers and I were all involved in group therapy because we had all been sexually assaulted repeatedly by the son of a family friend. I was too young to remember those sessions, though, and the molestation didn't actually end for years following, nor was that the only individual to do so.*

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things.. I logically understand that this is just a downtime for me and that it'll pass eventually, even if it takes weeks; but I feel like I'm so tired. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I hate this world we live in, my two best friends are only great for shallow socializing. They don't understand my diseases and I just isolate myself for weeks at a time because I have no one to turn too. My roommate is fantastic, he's always been there for me but I can see how much it wears him down. I'm tired of being a burden. 

I've always pushed people away and I really just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm just so so so so so exhausted of fighting my illnesses. I'm tired of constantly fighting an uphill battle. I think it might be time for me to leave this world, if not now then soon.

I think what really, really makes me angry is that I know I'm acting irrationally, it's like the real me is forever trapped inside a glass, sound-proof box screaming that it'll be okay and watching myself lash out in anger. I'm watching myself isolate myself from the people I care about and I can't do anything about it. It's like watching my own demise, like watching myself drive off a cliff.

"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing.

Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it.

And still no one asking about me in the main chat.

It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier.

"I‚Äôd like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. 

I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasn‚Äôt in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like I‚Äôd never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which I‚Äôve not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon.

I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasn‚Äôt until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel I‚Äôm lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldn‚Äôt afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered they‚Äôd been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas.

I never knew my father either, in fact I didn‚Äôt even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didn‚Äôt understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage.

I guess all in all what I‚Äôm trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, ‚ÄúIf you have running water and a refrigerator, you‚Äôre better off than half of the worlds population.‚Äù I‚Äôve always hated lines like that, I‚Äôve certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is ‚ÄúI never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess I‚Äôm just struggling with moving past darker days right now...

"Happy new year. A time when we both look toward the future and look backwards to the past. My future is a dark plcew, a horrible place of nothing but additional resonsibility, more expecttion, and yt more grief, more dissapointmnt, and more angisih. I feel as though I died many years ago. I am now thirty years old, and yet I attempted suicide in my late teens and early twenties. After theray and drugs, and finding true love, I recovered. But this is not  story of a mistreated hero. I am no antgonist of fiction, striving to overcome hardship. My hardship is of my own doing. My heartache is of my own creation. It is cliche to say that it is because I broke up with a girl. I broke her heart and now she is nothing mre than a distant memory. 

I am 30 now, but I figure I broke up with her about 6 or seven year ago. We were together for six years. I'd love to say I was different then but I'm quite sure I was more or less as I am now. This was the kind of love you find once in a lifetime. I have never communicated with one I felt so in tune with. I have never had someone be so patient with my issues. She forgave all my flaws and yet encouraged me to do better. For a while she made me feel as though I was someone ele. I told her I knew if we ever broke up it would be my fault, but she never believed me. 

I'm writing this now as an older man, supposedly moved on, supposedly mre sccesful. I am supposed to have learned and lived and fund new relationships. Many years ago she forgave me, and yet I feel mre and more grief as the years roll by. 

You see lthough I knew that I was incredibly lucky to have found love with oe such as her, I was totally and inexroably unfaithful. This woman loved me. I know this because she put up wit my flaws, and she taught me lie lessons I still repeat today. She is now with a man, or at least he was th last time we spoke, which was around three years ago. She looked healthy last I saw her, when she was with some new guy called Dave, and I noticed she looked so much healthier than I had ever seen her. She was so much more lifeike, confident, and vibrant than she ever was with me. I don't know if she is still with him. I a't brjng myself to messga eher, although not a minute of my waking life passes that she doesn't cross y mind. I miss her so much. Let me tell you that I miss her so very much. I have never told anyone close to me that I miss her, and even if I did tell any of my close confidants, I know no one from the time in which I know the girl I love, so to them it means very littele. More tan enanything in this world I miss her and I cannot possibly type this enough for it to portray how much I feel it. 

One night, 6 year ago or so, I ucked some other girl. I got drunk with a couple of friends on a randm nght out, lost contrl of my senses and my mind. Another girl, some stranger, some nothing, ws flirting with me, and through a series of terribe decisions I ended up sleeping with her within a couple of hours of meeting er As son as I it was done, I relaised what I had done. I called my ex, I tld her in no uncertain terms what I had done. THt I had cheated on her. I had slept with a stranger. I had been drunk. The scream. The scream of sheer angusih I heard down that phone haint s me even no. I cannot explain to you how much that killed me, istening to hr heart brek. This girl had put up with so much from me. She had gone through so much already and now this. That scream still haints me. She was on her way to the shops to pepare a nie surprise for us both when I told her this. She went back home nd I culd hear in her voice she was crying. I was staring at a wall, a foot away from it. I didn't feel like I was even me. I could hear ahe was crying. WHen she got back to her flat all I caould hear was her scream. She had held it in. She cried out, half echoing the word ""no"", half screaming and then she sobbed. I was whispering that I was so sorry. SHe screamed in the most cutting and now angry way ""Why?!""... ""Why would you?!"" I  just told her I was drunk, mindlessly drunk. SHe told me it was over. I agreed, I didn't blame her at all. I knew exactly what I had done. 

I have never been the same since. Judith has told me she forgives me. Was slept together after  year or so. SHe old me I need to learn to forgive myself. But this was five or o years go. Every day since I hve been a shell. I am not me. I diedd years go. I tried to kill myself before i knew her but never since. I just crrried on. I hate myself and my god, my gs. I have hated myself ever since. I am guilty. I m shameful. I broke dher heart. I am scum. I ha something perfect, and I reuined it. I mss her so much. 
I havehad a lot to drink. I tried to stop drinking sicne I cheated on her, blaming the alcohol But here and there, on nights like tonight, I have still turned to the bottle. I want to kill myself tonight. I hate myself. She is with another man, she is another persn, I am another person, she probably has kids by now. SHe is with me every waking hour and every waking day and my god I just can't forget wht I have done. I went back to university, decided to reinvent mysef and escape my past. But I haven't been happy in years. I cannot overcome this, and I should try to kill mmyself. I'm thinking of getting a lot more drunk and cutting my wrists or my throat. Deep enough that I bleed out in the bath. Even if it doesn't kill me, the act would bring me back to a time I feel more comfortable with. I have been so alone since this happened. THis is not the story of a person dealing with hardship. This is all my fault. I broke her heart. I just can't go on being this peron. I cnnot make sense of my narrative, I cannot make this sotry right. I do not want to break my mother's heart by killing myself. I t destroy her too. But I just can't go on anymore and I don't know what the fuk to do. lease if anyone can say anything that makes me feel remotely better, fuck it even if you just try, please do I will rad all of your messages.

"//depressive rant
My friends always ask me why I never hang out with them. Not all the time, but whenever I do actually go out with friends it always comes up at one point. Yet nobody actively invites me to things. Sometimes they do, it seems random sometimes I don't particularly have one main group of friends. 

Honestly this is because I'm afraid. I'm afraid that if I actively tried to hang out with people, I'd end up scaring them away. I've kept myself locked up for years, because I always relied on people to invite me, rather than me planning it out/asking to join along. 

I'm not friendless, but I convince myself I am. I would sit in my house for a week, with my only social contact would be at work, and I'd get depressed. I'd feel lonely, feel like I have no friends, nobody to talk to. Yet people message me almost every day. I get invited to things occasionally, and some people have told me that I can hit them up if I ever want to hang out. But I never do. Not unless they invite me. I fucking hate myself.

//actual post

I didn't try today. I know I could have hit someone up, but I didn't. Someone asked me what I was doing today, told them I didn't know, they told me I should get fucked up with them. Never happened. I didn't even fucking try. Now I'm sitting at home, high as a fucking kite, have had a nasty anxiety attack the entire day, I'm fucking sick of it. My girlfriend is at work so I can't actually do shit. So fuck it. I'm getting high and playing video games, because fuck me.

EDIT: Since I'm high and on the self hate train that I'll have to clean up tomorrow, might as well go deeper because fuck it. I love how I paint this ugly picture and believe it's real. I always make myself lower than everyone else, and I never cut the bullshit even when I realize it's bullshit. I love how I fucking realize all the anxiety in my head, yet I let it get to me anyways. I should be better than this.",4,"always relied on people to invite me, always make myself lower than everyone else,  high and on the self hate"
"I really don't know what to do. The only time I don't feel this just... soul-crushing sadness is when I'm with who I consider to be my best friend. I'm really bad at talking to people and when I try to talk to people about my problems they often don't take me seriously. I also have really bad self esteem.

I've come to realize that what I used to think were good, close friends were just people who were just people that have the ""I'm here for you, but as long as I'm having fun"" mentality. Once I came to this realization, I stopped being the one to initiate conversations and activities outside of school and sure enough, almost none of them invite me to anything or talk to me outside of school and I'm left feeling just.. alone.

Every time I'm around the people who I consider to be my real friends, I feel a bit better. When I'm not talking, I constantly just feel useless, empty and alone. I know my parents love me but ever since I confronted my mother about my problems, she both blamed my problem on playing too much video games and basically told me just to be happy.

Very few things bring me happiness at this point. I thought starting a channel on Youtube and making videos regularly would help take my mind off of my problems so I did for a while. Over the course of a few months, I've gotten some really nice comments telling me that they genuinely enjoy my videos and that they'd like to see more, and that really made me happy. But then once that feeling wore off I felt like I was back to square one. I wish there was a way to enjoy my life without having to work my ass off for a temporary solution

Sometimes, when I'm alone, I just want to let it all out. I'll want to cry so badly but won't

"I normally work out a lot but last year was so bad I even cancelled my gym membership. This year I actually started working out again and when I noticed I had started making some progress I made myself a goal to gain 10 kg this year (since I had lost some weight last year). Today is the last day of the year and this morning the scale showed that I've gained exactly 10kg! I also know that almost all of it is muscle mass, so this is the fittest I've ever been. I just wanted to share this here because I actually felt really good about this, which is a feeling I very rarely experience nowadays.

The thing is though  now when I got home after NYE I don't feel this happiness at all anymore. I actually feel more alone and miserable than I've felt in weeks.",5,"gained exactly 10kg ,feel more alone, miserable"

"So I've felt this way for a while I'm 15 years old and a guy. I guess I've just lost confidence after this girl I put so much into sort of rejected me without asking her to go out (friend zoned me and has really sloppy replies now when I can see she is replying to others). My family constantly make jokes about me and say that I look retarded and ugly, etc. And I honestly just make jokes about it but it really effects me. I guess I just need to talk to someone as I've reached another new low. My friends don't really talk to me too much anymore, but give me confidence at the same time. I just feel so ugly as I can't even take a picture and look good, and I feel really ugly especially from the side. My nose is large and sticks out and my ears are ugly but hey I'm greatful still. I'm 5 ft 11 and weigh 135lb which is pretty light and I've been working out for about a month but stopped for the past week. I guess I'm just looking for advice from people who have been through the same. I just feel like I may never be accepted.

"I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.

I hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says ""that's not true,"" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I need to start my life over, but how? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my parents and my sisters and my family. But I feel so hopeless. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm 23 and I feel like my life is over.

"These are goals I want to keep for at least the first month of January. I'm going to be able to seek out therapy again now that I'll be living in Seattle for the rest of the year instead of bouncing between Seattle (work/school) and home for holidays.

*-I am done with talks of suicide with my loved ones.*

I understand it is so stressful to have a partner or a daughter or friend who just shuts down every other night and says she wants to die. Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.

*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*

And by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.

*-I will take care of my body.*

I notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.

*-I will believe in myself.*

No more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.

*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*

No more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.

Maybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes. I can tell a friend about a bad day sure. But my deep issues are really too spoken of too often these days and I know it needs to stop.

"I'm severely depressed but not suicidal. I feel disconnected from almost everyone and everything. I know what needs to be done to change things but have no motivation to do so. There are times where I'm so down I just want to cry. I keep being told I'm a great guy, a good person, that I'm loved.

I give myself exactly as much credit as I deserve and have very little to offer. Yes I have good qualities but they're dwarfed when compared to what others have to offer.

"hey guys, this is something that i dont really do. Usually i use reddit for giggle and shits but now that im so depressed and desperate and i have no one to talk to i come here hoping i can pour my heart out before it pours blood out from sharp objects.

there's this girl, my best friend. Known her for like 3 years and i never thought i could love her so much, for in the past i saw her as annoying and stubborn and whiny but as time goes by i couldnt help but fell madly in love with her (without her knowing). I did make a move last summer but she straight out rejected me. We had a big fight and didnt talk to each other for like 2 months, worst 2 months of 2017, wanting to kill myself all the time and constantly being cynical to everybody. 

But we bumped into each other again at the end of November i think and she cried a lot and she hugged me saying she missed me so much and it was like, the warmest hug i've ever had in my entire life and at that moment i realized i dont want to lose her again, it kills me without her, inside and outside. 

But it's happening again, one night when a friend asked me how i was doing (he knew about my feelings for her) so i told him i still had the same feelings and he said that i should give up because she made it clear to him that she didnt want to take a step further with me. So i was very upset that night and i told him i couldnt because i was in too deep and i couldnt back out and nobody could help me back out and that he shouldnt care, nobody should care because i was dead, i was dead from inside to outside and nobody could help me. Only i could help me but i didnt want to. 

So my friend, i dont know what the fuck he has been thinking, thought it would be somehow of a solution to just tell her how am i feeling and you know what, she got all cold and wouldnt talk to me for weeks. I knew what was wrong but i pretended i didnt know anything. I dont want anything to mess with my head rn because im having an exam in a couple days. But i cant stand the harsh and dry tone when i wish her a nice christmas and new year and thank her for her christmas gift, i tried to ignore it and played it cool but deep down i just want to fucking kill myself to see if she cared. 

she said that we need to talk after my exam and i fear that i might get rejected again and it could also seriously damage our friendship too and i fear that we might break it. I dont want to loss her, she's the reason why i stopped thinking about killing myself buf i cant stand just being her friend. I sometimes think am i those cringy love desperate ""nice guy"" neckbeard who hates women because they reject them on the internet but i think im different. I've known this girl for 4 years now and i cant help but love her for who she is, not just some random hottie to DM on the internet. 

you guys can call me a wimp for whining over a subject that people constantly laugh at (the friendzone), i dont care, i just want to write something down to empty my thoughts for a while because the one person whom i always talk to when i have problems is now cold to me. Pls dont say there are other girls or there are many fishes or stuff like that, im told that and i also tell ppl that a lot and im sick of it. It's like when you're dying sick and the doctor tell you not to die and you can miraculously live. I spend too many brain cells picturing the hanging noose and pills and the razor and i smoked a lot (started smoking when she rejected me for the first time) and my chest hurt and i couldnt sleep well at night and i cant smile anymore.

if you make it down here i thank you sincerely for taking time to read and sorry for lack of punctuations and apostrophes because i write this feeling very bad and i couldnt cry though i want to but i just couldnt, i cant and my hands are shaking rn and i want to kill myself so bad rn. help me im suicidal, no you cant",4,"she straight out rejected me, wanting to kill myself, started smoking "

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know.  This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place.  This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb.  The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive).  

I've no idea what to do anymore.  Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for).  I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse.  

It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static.  People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person.  Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human.

"I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.

"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now.

"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree. 
All I have is my cat.

"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

My parents are both 61 and may die before I even find happiness in my life. But honestly I want to die first.  ",1,"degraded by other men,not seeming masculine enough, few people understand that men have feelings too.another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness ,"

"i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. 

culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives.

is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. 

society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. 

buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck. 

i used to feel like an outsider-- an alien walking around this foreign planet--, but lately i feel like it's the other way around, like all these sheep are prancing around this perfect world and i'm seeing it for what it is.

I am fortunate and appreciate all that‚Äôs been given to me in my life.

Several hours of harsh yelling would be the result of accidentally forgetting to rinse out the mop as a third grader.

I would be terrified to play outside of the privacy of a locked room. Despite this, I no longer hold blame to my parents. That is all that they were taught, although nothing can make it right. To this day, I panic when someone of authority even raises their voice slightly. But I believe that forgiveness may as well be the first step to forgiving myself.

"My boyfriend, a couple of his friends and a couple of my friends went out tonight to a bar. We were all kind of drunk and my boyfriend's friend asked a friend of mine if he take a shot from her belly button and she said no. He then asked me and u felt bad for him because he seemed really desperate, so I laid on the pool table and one of my friends poured the shot in my belly button and put a lemon in my mouth. He did the shot and then took the lemon out of my mouth with his mouth.


My boyfriend is very upset. I was buzzed and was just having a good time and I didn't mean anything sexual by it.


We have been dating for a couple of months.



What should I do to make things right with him? I love him a lot and only want to be with him. I tried talking to him and he gives me one word answers and walks away. I have been crying for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I have anger and emotional problems and I'm not sure what's wrong with me.

"I‚Äôm 26, all my friends are either happily in relationships or married and I‚Äôm the only single one in the group and have been for a while and it‚Äôs been a long running joke amongst us. So much so that one of them tagged me in a Facebook post this morning that said ‚Äúguess who‚Äôs not getting a kiss on New Years.‚Äù I was the only one they tagged in it. 

Do you know how that feels? To have your fucking day ruined before you even get out of bed? It feels pretty goddamn amazing when you‚Äôve been numb to everything for a while.

Later on I had plans fall through with some engaged friends who decided they‚Äôd rather spend the evening together just the two of them. Okay, that‚Äôs fine, I understand they don‚Äôt get much time together because of work but don‚Äôt agree to make plans with me then decide last minute to change your mind. Especially on a night like tonight.

What else happened? Oh yeah.

I even asked the girl I‚Äôm interested in if she felt like doing something with me tonight after she got of work. What was her response? 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Wow, fucking 3 for 3. I‚Äôm batting a thousand today in the ‚Äúno one wants you around‚Äù category.

I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't.

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me. 

it would just be nice to know i had someone like that for me, too. ",2,"tuition sucks ,apply to scholarships, to pay out all these loans, feeling lonely,  alone"

"Exactly this day, one year ago, i was devastated from a broken relationship, i was also got laid off from my work. It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me. After our broke up, i broke down mentally, i can't feel anything, can't do anything anymore. I was working two job and still in college, i tried my best to stay calm and collected when i'm study and at work. I barely pass the semester, got fired at my second job because i can't keep my mind clear, at least I still have my first job with me. Now, at the end of 2017, i was in that exact same place where i ended 2016, even worse than that. I just hope that i have the strength to go through 2018 without repeating any of that mistake, because i'm too tired of me ruining my life with my overthinking, i try so hard to control it, but i just keep doing that, and it results in me making stupid decision that keep ruining my life.",4,"broken relationship, broke down mentally, lose trust, lost job"

"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct.

To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything.

Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence).

There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness).

Emotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.

"The only social media I use often are Youtube and Reddit. I have a Facebook account, but there are no pictures or info and I don't go on it often. I gave in and was curious about what people were posting on New Year's Eve...and I immediately regretted it. Most people were posting their 2017 highlights and boy did they make me feel worthless. One that really got to me was the one who posted about their engagement, moving into their own place together, graduating college, traveling, etc. I just broke down crying for 10 minutes straight after reading her post. 2017 for me was a blur. I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful. I just sit in my room alone trying to pass time with the internet. I hate it so much. It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't have a computer, phone, etc to occupy me so I would not feel tired or useless and instead put effort into making friends. 

To anyone who read this, thank you so much.

"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.

"Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active.
--

I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure.

I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever.

I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.)

"Yesterday it was the 31st. My aunt's birthday. She is 70 years old.

I used the last bit of my money to buy her pizza, wings, and fries. You know, to treat her. I even massaged her back. I offered to do other stuff for her should she need it, like I always do.

Do you know what happened in the end? She stormed out of my apartment, screaming at me about how much she hates me for ""envying"" her. She randomly brought up topics of the past. Some of which aren't true, such as her saying I abused my cousin back when he lived near me. I've treated her to so much in the past few months, and I thought such a nice gesture would make her happy. I guess not.

""If this is my last day on Earth, good, because now you know the truth.""

An actual quote from her.

Yesterday, on the 31st, I tried to be a good person. I was left crying in my bedroom instead. Now it's 2018. And things look bleak. My boyfriend recently broke up with me. During my relationship with him, I was the happiest I have been in a long time, perhaps ever. I had 0 suicidal thoughts while in that relationship. Now it feels like he's ignoring me despite wanting to just ""be friends"".

Anyone could read this, even people I know, but I don't care. I don't care about anything anymore. I'm left wanting to die constantly. Anything is better than continuing to live this life I live. I just don't care anymore. I don't matter. I'm useless. My own mother is mentally unstable, and now I am too. I inherited it. The conditions I grew up in made me who I am now. I can't get a job. I can't get money. I can't be happy.

"I really want to stop myself from watching porn..

I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual. I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. 

I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing..

When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it.  I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it.

"Every time I type something up here I think of all the times I've been psychologically tortured by ""friends"" and just people online to the point of it being more harmful than my own mental illnesses that I get scared.

Tonight I'm not scared.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.

I don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done.

So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep.

I‚Äôve been depressed. I‚Äôm not diagnosed, I‚Äôm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that I‚Äôll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. I‚Äôm scared that my dad, who‚Äôs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say it‚Äôs not a real condition.

I‚Äôm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. I‚Äôm scared that it won‚Äôt get better. 

I‚Äôve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. I‚Äôve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasn‚Äôt on my mind. I never had many friends so I‚Äôve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure I‚Äôll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down I‚Äôm not the one really there. That‚Äôs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if I‚Äôm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I can‚Äôt afford it, when really it‚Äôs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I don‚Äôt even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like I‚Äôm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I can‚Äôt. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúI‚Äù am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. I‚Äôll binge watch a show on Netflix, I‚Äôll get lost in the story of a game, I‚Äôll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, I‚Äôve lost interest. Those shows and games don‚Äôt work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because I‚Äôve just detached myself from reality.

Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards?

"Just today.

Suddenly feeling utterly hopeless. I haven't fantasised about dying since the short time I did 3 years ago.

I feel no interest in doing anything else since Sunday... not schoolwork, continuing to look for a job, gaming, reading, watching movies or anything today. I have written a haiku but that is all I have done this morning. I like their syllable structure and it's easy to work with. I have started trying writing poetry a little bit just this weekend as oddly enough I am interested in that.

I have been fantasising about dying since yesterday. I guess because I feel like I already am dead. I can't tell anyone or more therapist because they'll probably lock me up in a hospital or something and that is neither pleasant for me, plus it would inconvenience everyone else.

Since playing this stupid horror game for a little bit today that a friend has recommended, the fantasies have gotten a bit more intense. I am not going to actually do it but it is weird to me that usually my depression manifests itself as only apathy with hopelessness. Now I feel pure despair and almost a self indulgent desire to pass away and not have to fight anymore.

I just really, really want to give up. I have a great family, great educational opportunities, decent health and a family that help me through so much of my stupid shit. I am a useless sack of shit that i can't take advantage of all the things I have going for me. I think literally everyone would be better off not having me around. I feel like such a burden to everyone yet they don't want me to relieve them of that burden (me) and me of my burden (having to keeo fighting myself) and it feels bad.

"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

I know you are all probably thinking...""here comes some guy who just got dumped and he is feeling depressed so he comes here to bitch and complain.""  That is not the case.  I have had depression my whole entire life.  Im 28 and have been under serious treatment for about 4 years now.  

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.  

Suicidal thoughts have swirled in my head for as long as I can remember.  At the height of my depression I began to self harm.  Nothing life threatening, but enough to draw blood and feel pain.  While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

I want my life to be over...Im sick of hearing ""things are going to get better"" . ""try this new brand name medication that costs 500 bucks a bottle.""  ""youre a great guy just give it time""

"I met my best friend in freshmen year of college. I had been suffering at my worst from my depression prior to that year in high school. Fall semester of freshmen year was the first time in about 5 years that I almost felt ""normal."" That friend was my dorm mate. We were completely randomized but hit it off really well since the beginning. We spent so much time together all of our mutual acquaintances would ask where the other was if absent. Then came spring semester and the depression was back full blown. We both have depression the kind right now where you don't feel anything, and nothing excites you anymore. It started to get noticeably worse for the both of us as school progressed. We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. 

They're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful.

"hi everyone

I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. 

but tonight brought on an depressive episode that I‚Äôve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill myself.‚Äù

When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. 

I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. 

I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù to suicide. 

Time to start the countup over. ",3,"cover all my old scars, planning a tattoo, researched lethal doses"
"hi --
For reference, I'm 21 and female.

First of all, I have a sister who is depressed. I know what that looks like: she contemplates the futility of her existence; she thinks she's worthless and generally has a deep-seated self hatred; on bad days, she cries herself to sleep and on the worst days she doesn't feel anything at all. I support her as best I can, but she often gets frustrated with me because I seem very far-removed from her mindset. I've always been a happy person, self confident (some might say to the point of arrogance), productive, etc. In particular, my sister cares a lot about what people think of her, and she often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

As much as I can enjoy living, I have no attachment to it. It's like the self-preservation instinct isn't there. I don't fear death, and I've experienced a good amount of physical pain in my life and I don't fear that either. I often just feel very removed from myself - disassociated - as if I'm looking from myself from very far away. Often I don't think of myself as a person but as a function of my activities (recently, a lot of work). Yes, I love people and I take an interest in intellectual material and I live both for the people in my life and my inner world, but if it makes any sense it often feels like my inner world itself is an external phenomenon, like I have no self. To borrow a line from Sylvia Plath: ""I am nobody. I have nothing to do with explosions."" And if it offers any insight: I don't cry very much, but when I do it's almost never for myself - it's for something larger and more abstract, like the Holocaust, or the rape crisis in India.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I can be charming and engaged - I'm a creative type and very tactile. I'm confident in myself. Above all, I am happy making meaning within my own life, at peace with the knowledge that its significance is purely relative. But when I refer to myself it feels like I'm referring to some construction outside of myself, like the 'I' is still some distance away. For that reason, my self-preservation instinct in pretty switched off. I often think of death - not in a longing way, just in a morbidly curious way. Everything I value I can just as easily disengage, because those values seem arbitrary. The world is a beautiful place but it will keep turning without me (and everyone else). I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but my detachment sometimes scares me.

Is this normal, to an extent? Or is something wrong with me?",4,"sister who is depressed, often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

"First post here, and I actually hoped that I never felt like I needed to address these things. 

It's new years eve, its 5am here in Denmark. And i'm done.

So long story short.
I was 130kg (287 pounds) at 15 years old. My parents pretty much didnt really care, and all that.
When i turned 15, i knew there was 6-7 months for high school to start, so i joined a gym. Read all i could online. Lost 40kg, at for the first time looked like a human being. Yet, I couldnt get with any girls. I was pretty much ""broken"" in the head for being too fat and weird. I didnt give it. I read Mystery Method, The Game, practiced all the time, and had some luck. I finished high school, and after that, my genetics pretty much fucked me over. 

Keep in mind, I work out 5 days a week. I even became a personal trainer. But my genetics makes it very difficult to lean down all the way, and i also (like my father, and brother) have a pretty chubby face.  im in my mid 20's and my hair is thinning so bad, and people keep mentioning this. 

Im the ugly guy, in my group, even though im the person who spends most time taking care of myself. But im just ""gentically ugly"" so to speak. Ive seen so many girls around me, hook up with wrong guys, and ""friend zoning"" me. I had a crush on a girl, who hooked up with a 20 year old idiot douche, just because he is better looking, basically because of genetics. 

I hate this. I dont deserve it. I always try my hardest. Best at my school at software programming, best at most things that I do, because i keep figting for what i want. But I dont wanna do this shit anymore. Im giving up. Im not getting any ""wins"" with my life. I see myself struggling and fighting so much more than other people my age...

im in my mid 20's. This should be the best years of my life, but im only getting uglier, and I cant take it anymore...

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it.

2) I didn't reach my fitness goal to finally do a pull-up. In fact, I haven't worked out the entire last month since thanksgiving threw me off my schedule.

3) I attempted suicide.

4) I failed at my attempt.

5) I went back to college and still fucked up, albeit much less so.

6) I barely got to know anyone new.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

i met her (i‚Äôll call her megan for the story) through some mutual friends. at the time she was dating one of my best friends (i‚Äôll call him danny for the story). so i had a class with megan‚Äôs bestfriend(i‚Äôll call her gwen for the story) &amp; danny, and we all got along perfectly. then suddenly me &amp; megan(she doesn‚Äôt attend this school) become close friends through snapchat. apparently our sisters are friends &amp; we related a lot through music. well about a month later, gwen &amp; danny aren‚Äôt aware me and megan are really close friends friends. then at like 2:00 in the morning she sends me a text talking about her feelings for me &amp; not gonna lie i felt the same. we have officially ‚Äútaken‚Äù each other, but she still hasn‚Äôt broken up with one of my best friends danny. well danny &amp; gwen learn &amp; gwen was cool with it. but danny hated my guts. this was like the third time a girl he liked or dated turned to me. i was known for getting his ‚Äúsloppy seconds‚Äù. me and megan get into an argument &amp; stopped talking &amp; dating.

fast forward about 4 months-
she‚Äôs at my school &amp; i have a girlfriend at the time. but i really felt megan like really felt for her &amp; i still do... but now danny, megan, and gwen go everywhere together &amp; all 3 hate me. gwen cut me off cause i‚Äôm ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù, danny pretends to be my friend but turn on me &amp; consistently make plans w/o me &amp; megan. i try SO hard to be her friend and it‚Äôs just not working. she avoids me &amp; it fucking torture. i lost her, and i knew i deserved it. i should‚Äôve never argued, i should‚Äôve never said anything. it constantly pains me, watching her smile with all my ‚Äúold‚Äù friends. i just need advice or help. i just need a glimmer of hope.",4,"we have officially ‚Äútaken‚Äù each other, but she still hasn‚Äôt broken up with one of my best friends danny"
It‚Äôs just sad that there‚Äôs a bigger chance of me killing myself than things getting better this year.,5,bigger chance of me killing myself than things getting better this year
"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.


But when they ask ""How was your holiday?"" how can I do anything but dodge the answer or lie?


So now it is 2018.

"I just, I wish admitting I lost everything would help me heal, because of delusional, naive, immature, greedy, selfish, entitled, privileged feelings. 

I'm still making awful mistakes..like I haven't learned anything. 

but I just, I can't accept everything that has happened without crumbling completely. 

I am still doing exactly the same things over and over again because I'm an idiot. because I can't just decide to do different. because I'm weak and broken. 

nature can be cruel. why should it be any different? Why should I expect any different? if I want to ignore the rules of society, then am I no better than an animal? should I be treated like on?

I'm just miserable and there is a sickening certainty I have about things only getting worse. 

I'm crying out to people who can't help me. I feel like I'm screaming into a void. I feel helpless and broken and weak and ignored and worthless. 

why did my life have to turn into this. I made mistakes yes. but like this? this is what I deserve? wishing to die in my sleep because I find no joy in life, no passion, nothing to pursue or take interest in. I haven't committed suicide over these last 6 years, fighting the urge on a weekly basis at the least, because my family doesn't deserve to experience that pain. 

was I such a terrible person to deserve this? or do I continue to see all these little choices as things that don't matter, when they are exactly what should be of most importance. 

I'm just going to rot away. I'm sorry I can't do better. I signed up big time and I can't recover from it. I'm always going to be stuck with this deep regret that I should have done differently. that I should have been smarter or more careful. 

but no. I just, took a huge risk, and lost just about everything. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't feel like myself. I feel like being hurt so much has fundamentally changed me, and I feel like I just don't have the ability to wait it out through small steps and hard work. 

I always worked hard. always. now I'm tired. I worked so hard just to throw it all away. I worked so hard to build the beginning of a good life just to get distracted by something shinier, and now nothing is as shiny as that thing, not even that thing itself. it's gone.. I have nothing left to look forward to. I'm broken and I'm miserable and I just wish the torture would end, one way or another. I can't take it anymore. I can't take these feelings, these regrets. I can't keep making excuses and trying to convince myself into something to make it seem less awful feeling. I can't even begin to convey the amount of pain this loss has caused. I can't stop feeling like I'm going to lose more unless I accept what I've already lost, be an adult and stop whining over things that can't be changed. 

I just, I've never let this stuff out. I've never taken down the delusion and stared my grief in the face. and sometimes I'm so numb from the pain that I don't even know what I'm missing. because it felt that way then, and it still feels the same. something important is missing from my life. I do not know what it is. I wish I did.",5,"why did my life have to turn into this, I made mistakes yes, but like this, this is what I deserve"

"It‚Äôs currently 4 in the morning and I‚Äôm feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, I‚Äôve had depression since about middle school. I guess I still don‚Äôt know if I want to call it depression since I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed yet but I‚Äôve always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school I‚Äôve never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said that‚Äôs from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other people‚Äôs problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and I‚Äôm still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Year‚Äôs Eve but, while I still care about them, I don‚Äôt want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months I‚Äôve tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. It‚Äôs been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now I‚Äôm stuck trying to solve my situation alone because I‚Äôve been in it for so long that I‚Äôve isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like it‚Äôs so hard to find. My counselor hasn‚Äôt helped, my parents haven‚Äôt, and my past best friend hasn‚Äôt. I also have other ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but it‚Äôs been so hard to find. It‚Äôs made my depression worse and I‚Äôm starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least I‚Äôll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why I‚Äôm sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.
Thanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live.

The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it? ",5,"really hard, forced to live, despair"
"TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome. 

(This isnt well written, im never as smart on paper as i think i am in my head, but id love to hear if anyone relates to this or has any thoughts). ",5,"sad ,unhealthy, my eyes are hollow, donít recognise myself"

First with my dad's shotgun and the last two times I tried to hang myself on new years. 


 It's like survival instinct kicks in in the last second. 

I want to die so fucking bad. 

I want to be mugged and get shot after resisting. I want to die in a car crash. I want to have a terminal disease. I want to reach out for a cop's gun. 

 I fantasize about all the ways to die. But I just can't do it myself.

Am I going to be stuck with me and be miserable for the rest of my life?

I just want to know what i‚Äôm doing wrong with people for myself to be completely invisible. I feel incredibly isolated and I just want to feel alive.

"I am 25 soon and have been depressed since I was 15. I just can't see myself getting out of this mess. I used to think life would just ""work out"" as I got older but the truth is nothing has.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.


How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else.

"I don't even know anymore. Being alone fucking sucks. Being everybody's last choice fucking sucks. BEING TOO SCARED TO MEET NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK TO THEM WITHOUT HAVING A FUCKING PANIC ATTACK SUCKS. 11th of November. That's when my last real friend left me. Knew them for years, fought all the time. One day we kinda just drifted away and now we don't speak at all. It affected me a lot more, because they were all I fuckin had. Don't blame them. I'm a pessimistic, worthless, talentless idiot without anything good to say about myself. I can truly and wholeheartedly say without a doubt; 'I. HATE. MYSELF.' 

I don't know. I can laugh with people, I can joke around and forget everything. But sometimes it all gets too much and even if nothing happened that day, everything starts closing in on me and my heart starts beating faster and I just want to die. I dig my nails so hard into my legs and forearms that it draws blood and I shrink away wanting nothing more than to cry. But I don't. My friends either laugh at me or tell me it's bullshit and I'm just seeking attention. So I sit silently beating myself up with a blank expression, tearing up my own skin and planning a new suicide attempt.  

That's what it's like now. Nothing happened nothing FUCKING happened why is this happening to me I did nothing wrong I was OKAY, I was FINE but now I'm not and I want to die and I just..god. I can't even put it into words. I just want to die so much. So so much. My life is meaningless. I have no future to look forward to. I have no talents, no friends, nothing to live for. I haven't really done much these past few days. I haven't eaten since Saturday. I don't do anything productive. I've just laid in my bed with the blinds closed, staring at the fucking wall with drying blood on my hands and bandaged arms. No one notices. And no one WILL notice. Not until the neighbors notice the rotting smell in a few weeks. 

I suppose this is the end, right? I'll probably be dead and gone in a few days anyway. There's rope in my closet, pills in the bathroom, blades on my floor and a gun under my pillow. But right now I can't really get up. I can't get out of bed today.",4,"my last real friend left me, Don't blame them, I'm a pessimistic, worthless, talentless idiot"
"I had someone I barely know trying to offer advice last night. He's one of those ""you should go seek help"" types. No shit - wouldn't that be nice? 

I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. 

It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here. It's gonna take time 

I would like to talk to him more about it, but felt I needed to rant and hopefully clear my head. If anyone has suggestions, I would truly appreciate it 

Also, happy new year:)",3,"have multiple learning disabilities,mental illnesses, so much tension with family,"

"That's right folks, the second part to something no one asked for or even responded to. I don't think I'm going to stop just yet, though. Maybe I just want some attention. Or maybe I want people to know who I am. Maybe I'm just so hurt right now that I'll do anything just to be seen. Just to be spoken to. I am so very alone, and unwanted.

I am a broken man, and these are the attempts I made to become better for the woman I love, the woman I am no longer with.

Between the last part and this one, my therapist and I established a history of medications and treatment, and whatnot. When we got back into the real issues, it went as follows;

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life. It is important to get this information so that together we can get a clearer understanding of your past and current history. This will be very useful when we meet on Thursday as we review the therapeutic process and begin to start setting goals.

&gt; /////- I am sorry to hear that you experienced years of sexual abuse . You are definitely a survivor and a man of courage. In our society the trauma that men experience is sometimes swept under the rug, without any acknowledgement. You won't find that here. ALL of who you are and what you have experienced is welcome in this space and vital to your healing . Self knowledge and awareness is the basis of all knowledge . I am glad you took a chance by sharing something so personal. I can't imagine trying to deal with all of the thoughts, emotions and isolation this has brought into your life .

&gt; You know, I can't help but wonder how this trauma impacted your view of yourself, others , the world and your place in it. Have you ever talked about this part of your life experiences with anyone else ? Does your family or partner have any clue about all that you have been through ? You mentioned having siblings . Please tell me more about your relationship with them .

&gt; This is YOUR time for healing and renewal . No need to thank me for my time. You reached out for help and with a desire to learn how to grow into a better version of yourself and you are worth it!! Continue to believe in yourself by remaining open , speak your truth !! The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1,"sexual abuse, trauma"
"I‚Äôve posted here a lot over the last year on both this account and others. I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety for a very long time and it felt like things weren‚Äôt going to get any better. I was giving up. 
However, about 4 months ago I had perhaps the worse mental breakdown In my life. Everything kind of happened at once and I hit rock bottom. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go to work. I spent my days in my room crying. I was angry and miserable. I was a mess. 
Eventually my sister and brother in law came to my aid and pushed me to get better. We found me a new less stressful job away from my triggers. I opened up about my mental illness. I got a new doctor who took interest in my problems and prescribed me medication and guides to conquer them. I started a new job that I really enjoy. I also started dating this guy that has gone through some of the same struggles and understands how I feel. 
It‚Äôs been an incredible 4 months. I know it‚Äôs not this easy for others but I got lucky. I also want to thank the people who would give me advice. Thanks guys! Happy New Year! ",3,anxiety
"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things.

"Hi. First, English is not my first language, so some sentences might be weird. I post here because there's no other place better than here. People in my country will definitely blame or laugh at me.

I thought I was one of those people who are strong enough to use social media. I don't care about others are having fun or eating in good restaurants, or bought luxury stuffs or have partners. 

But recently after I saw one of my old classmates becomes a professional translator and another becomes a writer who have published 2 novels, I start to doubt that. I feel uncomfortable. And I'm uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable, because they were my friends. I feel awful. I don't know why. I feel shame. I think that although I have been knowing that I'm a loser, but it feels so much different when you see the real distance between you and others. It hurts.

A lots of people here suggest that it's better to just delete social medias. But that somehow makes me feel awful too. It's like, if I did it, it means I officially admitted I can't accept that others are getting successful but I am not. I feel there's a voice in my head laughing at me: ""Hey, look at what you want to do. You feel awful for seeing others being successful, and your way to solve this is, ha, to delete your social media? Instead of getting inspired and start to work hard and get your shit together? You just ganna run away? Pathetic!"".

"I don't even know how or where to start but I NEED to get a lot off my chest. 

My ideal life has always been to have a happy family. But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with. So, for the last 10 years i have been alone with just me and my daughter. I've tried to meet new women but i can't seem to find anyone that wants to be with me for more than a couple dates. I think it's because my depression, but i don't know. I haven't even had sex since 2007. I've tried apps and going to bars, but i don't drink alcohol so i feel awkward. I'm tired of being alone. I was raised by my grandparents and they have since passed on. I have NOBODY in my life that loves me besides my daughter. I want to find someone that can love me and my little girl as much as i could love them, but @ 35 years old it's beginning to feel impossible. Why won't anyone love me back? What is wrong with me? How can i find someone to love? I'm scared of dying alone. I'm worried my heart will remain broken till my death. I'm not a bad guy.

"Hello all. I‚Äôm a college freshman home for winter break. I‚Äôm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I‚Äôve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). They‚Äôre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that I‚Äôm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (I‚Äôm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while I‚Äôve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I don‚Äôt really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think I‚Äôll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and we‚Äôre still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. I‚Äôm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
I‚Äôve loved college, but haven‚Äôt really found a new best friend yet. I‚Äôve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope it‚Äôs not too late. Is it?

"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

.............................................................................................

How can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?

Basically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.

**A confession:**

You cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.

Crying is a distress signal, if the signal isn‚Äôt answered, it‚Äôs useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that you‚Äôll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.

The world has given us the middle finger and said ‚ÄúGoodluck dumbass, you‚Äôre on your own!‚Äù You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:

1. They weren‚Äôt ever there for you, and

2. You‚Äôve already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you don‚Äôt need people anymore.

You develop this zenn state where you feel as if you‚Äôre in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.

As a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night.

All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night.

It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years.

It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

"2 days ago, I called the national suicide prevention hotline. They weren‚Äôt that great in helping me out.

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then.

Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous.

But he never tells me about his life.

Even if I ask.

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him.

When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing.

Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently.

It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"In sorry if I don't write back to any replies. my anxiety makes it kind of hard to answer people.. but ill read comments if I do get any.. 

I just had my second son. having to wait until the 17th to get back on my meds. I've been clean from severe self harm for the whole pregnancy. in trying hard to maintain. were all aware I will probably have post partum depression since I suffered so badly last time. its started already. 

we all know how scary it is to see yourself circling the drain. knowing you can't stop the fall. 

I have 3 people besides my toddler and newborn sons. my husband of 7 years, my mom, and my best friend. my best friend I don't really like to reach out to. even though she is amazing, I adore her and she's extremely understanding and supportive (because she struggles the same as me). I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill. I feel like im begging people to help me and everyone is just tired...

To cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. 


For a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)

Unlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. 


I only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.


I suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?


Anyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy ""I'd be good the best boyfriend"" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clich√©, but I think it needed to be said.

He also believes taking medicine wouldn't help, even though I have tried to convince him.  He is suicidal at least once a day and I'm worried that one day he will just do it.

"I started to think recently on how toxic my parent's behavior has been over the years, but since every time I tried to call them out they dismissed me I struggled with seeing those things as emotionally abusive, just a clash of personalities with them being overly harsh and me being overly sensitive, and I feel guilty since I know they love me and have always provided for me and that there are people that have much worse parents. I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful:

* Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces

* Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt

* Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time

* Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle

* Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help

* Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in

* Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle

* Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around

* Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them.

* Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back.

* Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early.

* When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because ""women have body hair too"" instead of actually helping me.

* I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's ""biased""

* Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it.

* To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility.

* Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once

Ôªø* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again.

* Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him. Then went on a rant all the way back home.

* I lost count of how many mornings I woke up during a weekend to him washing the dishes while complaining at how much of a failure I am

* Dismissed and belittled my concerns, fears and problems over the years always saying something like ""what are you going to do about it"".

* Belittles my interests for being childish according to him.

* Get's angry at me for being scared of bugs and other ""feminine"" attitudes.

* Always makes me into the unreasonable one whenever I got visibly upset or angry at his behavior that he never apologizes for

* Always acts like he knows me better than I know myself, always sees malice in my thoughts and actions because ""he was once my age"". He never believes I'm genuine with the things I want or do, I'm always doing things because everyone is doing it.

* Constantly lies about things like pretending he took the dog to the vet, that he could not find something we asked him to buy, etc.

* Always use us as his emotional and verbal punching bags when he's frustrated at something or someone

* I always have to compromise, like not transitioning or always having my hair up now that it's long, but he never makes an effort to change or police himself on the things I've said that bother me over the years.

* To this day whenever he raises his voice or get angry even if I have nothing to do with it I get panicky.

* I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with him, if I say the wrong thing (speak my mind) or react the wrong way(react naturally) he's going to flip on me.

I was close to my father when I was very very young but the behaviors I listed started happening around when I was 6-7 so it's pretty much since then that I started to become distant, he feels like a stranger to me since I was about 14. With my mother we were pretty close and got along very well up until I was about 14. She's always been an anxious and jealous person but the bad things that happened in her past plus a lot of stress over the years made her insufferable. On top of anxious and jealous she's controlling, critical and judgemental. If I don't do things her way she won't stop criticizing me, if I call her out she starts pointing out my flaws. She's always looking for a opportunity to turn anything into a fight and then play victim and make everything about herself. If I get angry at her she just says I'm crazy and need to go to a mental asylum. She told me so many hurtful things over the years since I came out, that I'm retarded, that I'm a curse in her life, that she should have been a whore instead of a proper woman, etc. I can tell she regrets it after as she tries to hug and kiss me but she never apologizes. 

I know deep down they both love me and want the best for me, they had always provided and praised me and done what they could but when it comes to the emotional side of things I think they managed to break me completely while being completely oblivious to it, always suggesting I'm ""tired"" and ""moody"" due to a poor diet and lack of exercise and wondering why I'm like this or why I feel so uncomfortable next to them.

"I've been dealing with mild depression since October (self-diagnosed, nothing formal). I've mostly been able to deal with it. The last few months though, it's slowly getting worse. The lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyed activities. All I do is work is come home. On the weekends, I just turn hermit and avoid things. Even doing self care doesn't help.

Today, I haven't been out of bed except to go to the bathroom and eat a bagel. My roommate came in to talk and see if I was okay. He had helped me in the past deal with this, but even he's not sure what to do.

"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week).

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3,"intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up,feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health, my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me,prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness, "
"My depression has been up and down over the past 2 years. I've hit my lowest lows, but bounced back towards the highest highs. Recently it seems like I'm slowly going back down, and there's no incline in sight. If everything keeps going the way it is, I'll be farther down than I've ever been. When I was at my lowest, I was pretty ready to take my life. I felt almost a sensation of peace over myself knowing that soon enough I'll never have to feel this way again. I ended up not going through with it, and I talked myself away from those feelings for a good while, and I was feeling good. 

Now I have a kid on the way, almost halfway to the due date, and I'm going back down in the rut. It makes me feel like a complete piece of shit, but knowing that I can't just end it anymore is making it harder to deal with. In the past I've always had suicide as a plan if all else failed, and it made me feel a bit better knowing, if anything, it could all end. But with a kid on the way, I don't dare even think about it. I wouldn't want to have her resent me, or feel guilty in anyway, and now I can't seem to get over this feeling. 

On top of it all, my wife knows of my depression, but overall it feels like it's just a burden to her. I don't even want to talk to her about it anymore because it makes me feel like I'm just complaining and loathing in my own self pity. I'm just stuck where I am, and I hate it more than anything. 

As is, I don't have insurance, or really any money, so I can't seek out medical help. The only other people who I know that have depression is my mom and a friend. But my friend just makes jokes about it, and I have too high of anxiety to talk to my mom about it.

"Early September to early December, for lack of a better description, was a never ending hell for me. Failed all my classes, withdrew from a lot of friends, neglected all my responsibilities, and abused drugs heavily.

In December, I had a stint of self harm, suicidal thoughts, and crazy self destructive behavior that really made me start to think about the bigger picture. I always dismissed my depression, because I thought I was a ""pussy"" for not even being able to feed myself or accomplish anything more than smoking pot, popping benzos and playing call of duty during the day.

But deep down, I knew I wasn't a ""pussy""/loser/failure. And neither are you. I know it's unbelievably hard/impossible to disconnect from that negativity when you're deep in the hole, so I won't tell you to push through it. Because that isn't how depression works, you can't just will yourself to get over it.

What you can do, however, is be honest with yourself. You have depression. It is not something you can shrug off or will away, and it's become a centerpiece of your thought process everyday. 

BUT, you can remember a certain point in your life where you felt happy/content in a natural way. Was it drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise? Walking around in the woods with headphones on? A good lift in the gym? Being in the company of a good friend? This won't come easy. I've found it helps to write these things down, because your depressed brain will make happy recall very, very hard. Definitely try it out a few times if it doesn't work at first, over the span of multiple days/weeks. This is a process, not a quick fix. 

Now compare those memories to your current day-to-day routine. Me personally, I realized that my college depression was eating me alive, because I didn't have a routine. In high school, I was forced to do the same thing every day. As much as I hated it, I was achieving SOMETHING 5 days of the week. Going to classes, having to get dressed, made a huge difference in my life. Once I moved out and had freedom to do anything, I ironically did NOTHING every day. And that's when I realized really what the root of my issue was. Without accomplishing something productive on a day to day basis, my reward centers slowly started to fade away.

So I forced myself to wake up at 7AM every day, and walk around in the morning for 5 minutes. It was so fucking hard. I completely failed to do it for about a month, then got lucky one day and woke up feeling okay. Managed to accomplish those two tasks. Whoa! That wasn't so bad. I also had to cut out drug use from my life, because pot, benzos, and amphetamines were making it impossible to wake up in the morning.

Granted, I am nowhere close to being out of the woods. If I were to slip into drug use and disregarding my routine every day, I would fall back exactly to where I started. BUT, once you start to feel better, and REALLY internalize the negative effects depression has on your well-being, you can start to be much more proactive about your recovery. I honestly believe the biggest mistake all of us make when we start to feel better, is to disconnect ourselves with how we felt while depressed. It's not something you can leave behind and go back to your old ways. 

Not exactly sure how helpful all of that was, but I hope someone finds it beneficial. 

And for those reading who are currently deep in the hole, just start to introspect. A lot. Write things down. Post on here. Be creative. Hell, even talk out loud if it helps. When depression really, really kicks you to the ground, it has to be the #1 focus in your life. 

And, of course, feel free to reach out to me if you all ever need anything. Everyone deserves to feel content, fulfilled, and happy. Yes, you. I know it doesn't seem like it, but life is worth living &lt;3

Happy new year everyone :) ",3,"abused drugs,withdrew ,loser, failure,"
"I want to talk to somebody but don't know how. I yearn for some decent human connection, yet I don't know how to connect. I have friends. But most of them either don't have time for me, or don't care for me as much as I care for them, are bored with me or are boring to me. I won't to make new friends, meet new people. But it's not just hard, it seems next to impossible. I know a few places where I can meet people that I find interesting, but there are several but's. One of those places is a sort of a board game parlour. But that's one place. And I'm afraid that if I screw that up I won't be able to come there no more, or I'll have to avoid certain people. I feel like I might lose those opportunities and be left with no opportunities. And that scares me. I'm scared of being hopeless again. Because it's awful to have no hope and know you'll never have any glimmer of hope again. If only I had a group of best friends I could rely on, sort of a safe net, someone that's always there. But there are no people like that in my life. Let's say friends are coffee mugs and my life is a table. Most of the coffee mugs are near the edge, some are even halfway over the edge, always in danger of falling over, all it takes is one false move. Talking to someone new is like putting a new mug right on the edge, half on the table, half over the edge. It's fucking nuts. I can't take those risks, I suck, I know, but I can't. I'm not very interesting (at first at least) or articulate and a lot of people find that annoying. Even talking to people on social networks is scary. I just hate that sound of a ceramic mug  breaking on the hard floor. Most people do I think. When something beautiful full of possibilities breaks. I feel like every meaningful and real conversation that I've ever had happened by mistake, by accident, with little involvement from me.

"Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. 

I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. 

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. 

I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. 
They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. 
Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". 

I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents 

Any advice or opinion? I need help. Thank you. :) ",4,"verbally and physically abused, haven't graduated yet, abandoned,horrible childhood"

All I want is to die or have my love back, and I can't have either. Don't be like me.


This is a direct continuation of the last part. My therapist and I were still getting to know one another and were communicating primarily through messages, as I wasn't really comfortable with more. Once we began having actual sessions, there will be bits and pieces missing that I really can't account for too well.



&gt;  Hello ///// - Thank you for openly sharing your views about yourself, your beliefs and the relational history and status with your siblings. This could not have been easy, yet you did it. I wonder if the traumatic experiences you had made survival possible only if you were able to believe that you didn't matter. It's interesting because the very thing that you want to be able to give your partner is locked away even from you. I also wonder if doing things for the benefit of others is protective for you because it keeps you from expecting anything, thus never again being let down.

&gt; ///// - I know that you talked about not having faith in yourself or believing in yourself, because if you did you would have done ""more than you have"". Your honesty and the truth as you see it is welcomed and valued in this space. Have you ever had the experience of losing something, beginning to look for it and then finding something else that was previously lost? Perhaps this is what will occur for you on this journey. It doesn't matter WHY you are here , only that YOU ARE and that you are WILLING to consider multiple perspectives on what may be going on inside of you that is impacting your symptoms, relationships and view of self. I have a suspicion that you are actually willing , you just need a good, sturdy, yet flexible and toxic free bridge to hope. This IS your time /////. This may be what you have been waiting for all of your life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles, begins with ONE step.

*Hello, //////.*

*I don't know about it not being easy. For the people I actually trust, it is easy to divulge basically every thing. For those I don't, they will never know me. But I understand that it is vital to this particular relationship to forgo any subterfuge. If I had mattered to those who wronged me, they would not have done so. If I had mattered to myself, I would not have let those things happen. To say I was a child and knew no better stopped being a legitimate excuse when I turned 18. After that point, it's just been me fucking up without excuse. I know better, and I still keep fucking up. I don't know how to break myself from the cycle.*

*I don't know if I agree with that last bit, because, even though my interest or intent may not be for my own benefit, I do expect to occasionally result in theirs. To make them happier, to make their life better, to earn a place in it. I have never been successful in the end. That is a crippling kind of failure, feeling let down is an understatement. I am, each and every time. When it comes to my partners, there's nothing I don't try to give, nothing I'm not willing to do. And yet it always seems that I don't actually commit to that, I always let THEM down. And then myself when that relationship crumbles. It is no less devastating each time it happens.*

*I... Don't really know if I'd had that particular experience, no. I don't think I've ever really been 'looking' for anything, besides a relationship I can count on. I have stumbled blindly into and out of every relationship, every hobby or interest, every place I've ever been. I have never had a plan. I have always just winged it and saw how it turned out. The answer is, never really any good.*

*I believe that to say you want something is fine, but to not follow up is proof that you do not actually want that thing. To say, ""I wanna go there"" and then NOT go there makes you a liar. If you really wanted it, wouldn't you have done it? If I really wanted to be in better shape, wouldn't I have done it by now? No, I just don't want to do it badly enough. This is the first and only time I've tried to follow through, and even then, I do not think it may actually benefit my current reason to do so. I think I may have damaged my relationship to the point it cannot be fixed.*

*I'm more than open to other perspectives. For what it's worth, I know you're not wrong. I know the things you're saying are true. At least, the locked away part. The believing in myself, waiting for my time. I know you're not wrong in those things. I just can't believe in them, myself. I wish I could, but something keeps me from doing it. All that cliche crap about ""where there's a will there's a way"" and never giving up, some part of me really wants to believe it because I know it's a way out of this. I just don't know how to do that.*

*I tend to ramble, by the way.*

"Here is how pathetic I am. I am a 35 year old man (though I use that term loosely as I am pretty much a shitty example of one) and I have to post my problems to Reddit because I have no where else to turn to. I'll  give you the highlights. 

I have no friends and have always been the guy in the periphery of groups of friends. 

I was miserable in high school, probably had add or somethign. I was miserable in college and went to a shitty open enrollment commuter shool. 

I'm college I got my gf pregnant after dating her for two months.  She only wanted to work part time as a cashier despite the fact she has a nursing degree. I wanted to get my PhD as I was a liberal arts major and that was the only way to get a job. But I had to quit  that as I had to work two jobs (one full time) to support my new family. 

My only child doesn't even have my last name as my in laws have, over the last decade, tried to convince my wife I am going to walk out on the family. I have always sacrificed everything for them.

Despite a decade of working my ass off and sleepless nights I make less than 50k a year.


My wife developed depression and anxiety and was suicidal, she is now on meds. 

My wife also is infertile and we can never have more children, she also can't be intimate as she no longer produces mucous. I haven't had sex in three years and unless I have an affair (like that would even happen...... I'm too much of a loser for any woman to want that) I will never have sex again. 

My child has depression, anxiety, adhd,. He has been kicked out of one school already. Keeping him stable is a daily grind. I also missed most of the childhood moments working all those jobs and trying to do grad school. 

I drive a 13 year old car that just broke down for the third time this winter. 

My father has had several strokes and is 100% bed ridden, I have to help my elderly mother help him daily before I go into my low paying low prestige job. 

I no longer have my youth. 

I had less than $12k to my name. 

The only thing that made life bearable was drinking alone to just make stuff numb. I feel like I want to just give up and do that from here on out. Life is fucking shit, especially compared to where my peers are at in their lives. What is the fuking point. I am a loser in a very way imaginable

"I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. 


So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression ""fuck you!"" in the face. So fuck you depression! ",5,like everyone was better than me
"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself.

I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill

Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself 

These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more

Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space.

"Hi, I am a 19 year old man, so I am still a teenager who probably understands very little about life. Even so, lately I have felt terribly depressed for the reasons I will make known a little later. Before, I used to be a very happy person, I had a girlfriend with whom we were about to be 3 years together. She was also my best friend, we did everything together and she did not need anyone else (besides, i did not have anyone else, but that did not matter to me, while she stands with me, i didn't need any friends). The thing is that at one point we broke, at first I was very affectionate, but I ""got over it"" quickly and I felt pretty good. The problems came when I realized that I did not know how to relate to almost anyone, I did not know who to turn to constantly as a friend, not as an acquaintance whom I only see at some parties. At first I did not take much importance, because despite not having friends, I used to go out at night quite often with different people. I went from group to group, everything was super intermittent, I did not stay with anyone constantly because I was not sure how to do it. Then, I reached a point where I started to get depressed slightly from time to time, like when I was alone in my house or went out to do everyday tasks, the fact of being alone and realizing it depressed me . Although I felt bad, it was not something that happened to me often (About 3 days a week more or less), but with time it became constant, I began to despair because I did not have anyone by my side. I tryed to make friends , but they all went away in the passing of days. So, I also began to feel as if people hated me, as if nobody wanted me and preferred to get away from me, as if I were a bloodthirsty. At this moment I do not know what to do, I have many suicidal thoughts, I do not want to get up in the mornings, I do not even go out, I stay in my house locked up doing nothing. The thing is that I do not know how to make friends, and that's killing me, loneliness is getting worse. I've really tried a lot of ways to make friends, but they all end up leaving me and that only makes things worse as I said before. I want to ask for your help, I want to know how you can make friends (Because i really have no idea how to), how to avoid this loneliness, how I want to go out and stop thinking about committing suicide, but most importatly, how to make friends, i feel like that's all i need.

"When I look at all the problems I have to face and all the issues I've got; my crippling anxiety issues, my huge insecurities about every part of me and my overwhelming jealousy leading to loneliness and isolation it all just seems impossible and pointless trying to fix it. It just seems so hopeless even thinking about how to solve these problems as they all seem so overwhelming and connected that no matter what I do they won't go away.

I cannot even think of a place to start with all this mess because every time I try and fix something I'm just reminded of how this other issue will still be there and it's like whenever I come up with a solution another problem arises. What's worse is how every time I do try and sort my life out and it fails, which is every time, I become even more disillusioned and deterred from trying again in the future, because it will just be pointless. 

It's pretty fucking depressing that the first thought I wake up to on the start of a new year is how it would be easier killing myself then hopelessly trying to fix my problems. I wish I could just be rid of all this shit and be a normal person, it's fucking scary thinking about how this is how I could be forever.",3,"my crippling anxiety issues, insecurities,jealousy, loneliness, isolation, killing myself"

I am just so jealous of rich people that how much they can do and enjoy their life with.

Let's just all admit that happiness is really purely depend on how much freaking money you have, we need to stop telling people or ourselves that money isn't everything, this kind of denial mentality is so toxic!

The more and sooner we realize it's the fact the sooner we will be able to end our lives. Don't u agree with me?
It will never be better, it's just not! It's been so many years, things won't get better, period! We need to face it! I just don't have the balls to end it right now but it is the only way to get out- DEATH.

"This world is so funny... it really is..

People swear they are there for you. They say ""I'm here for you if you ever need me!"" but then when you need them, they don't answer your calls, they don't answer your messages, they blatantly ignore you. It takes back all the sincerity of the gesture to be there for you..

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

Don‚Äôt just sit on your ass, waiting for somone to give you a job. It‚Äôs common sense for a person to go out in the world and work his ass off no matter how much problems he has!

"I met my first girlfriend in high school, and I fell hard. She was smart, confident, gutsy, and the first person I felt comfortable talking about my kinks. She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. 

So college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.

Additionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.

I know It‚Äôs bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.

It‚Äôs been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel I‚Äôve let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didn‚Äôt work. The sexual frustration sucks. I don‚Äôt want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. 

I‚Äôm in a mental stalemate: I‚Äôve cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. I‚Äôve tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. 

Things are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. I‚Äôve binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges.

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2,"family financially ruined me, husband had a heart attack, can't drive, no savings, stuck in a place,hate, financially supporting my parents, point of abuse, have no savings"
"Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.

My doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.

I'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. 

As for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get ""brain zaps"" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.

Worst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.

My family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.

I have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.

I feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. 

This is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",3,"prisoner with this fucking drug anymore,  bouts of extreme anger, family have no idea"

"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetry¬† throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain.

"Tomorrow I will be going back to school. I am not looking forward to it in the slightest. To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.

Perhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive. I like the idea of driving around just for the sake of it. 

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. 

I'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness. Depression and isolation. A connection to someone else like no other. I am satisfied.

"19 male America. I am in a worse place than ever before and not entirely sure of who or where I am so please excuse any nonsensical bits or typos. To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever.

"Prepare for a long read: 

Im only 15 years old so in comparison to most of you i probably have had it easy but i just need to tell my story for some advice because ive been feeling like shit. So lets start off with my past; my parents got divorced when i was 4 years old than my mother got married to another woman and my father also got married again. I went to my fathers house every weekend so i didnt really miss him but when the years went on that changed into 3 hours a week and i really hated the fact i couldnt really be around him. Then in the following 5 years my grandparents died which ofcourse sucked but i never really cried and just put all the emotions aside. When i was 10 my mother woke me up, she was crying and told me that my father killed himself lastnight. He called the day before but i didnt get to speak to him because i was playing in the garden with a friend and whatever i would go to him 2 days later. I cried for probably 5 minutes and then again i put aside my emotions. Also at his funeral i barely cried and it felt terrible but i just wasnt able to cry. Since that day everything went downhill and ive never really been happy. My mother told us that she felt like a man and she got an operation and now looks like a man as well. She and my stepmother than used a spermdonor to get my stepmom pregnant and i got a little sister at the age of 12. I never really talk with anyone about my situation so everyone just assumes that my mother is my dad and my stepmom my mother and ofcourse i cant blame them. Im a very shy, anxious and introvert person. I also aint that good looking but im very smart (i skipped a year and follow the highest possible level of education) and a lot of people say im funny so thats the only thing im confident about. I used to have some really good friends and as a group we were pretty close but then i skipped the year and went to a different class and the contact just stopped and i was alone. Looking back i think skipping the year was one of the things that fucked me up big time because i went from multiple good friends to no friends at all. I never got out of the house and never really talked with anyone. Then i went to high school(idk what its called but you go there when youre +-12 y/o) and one guy of my old class went to that school aswell so we kinda became friends but that died of really fast aswell. Since im pretty ugly and shy there has never really been a girl in my live that really talked to me or cared about me. But 1.5 years ago this girl from school randomly started to text me and it didnt take long till i got feelings for her we went on texting and talking for months and got really close. But eventhough a lot of people told me she liked me i couldnt believe that anyone would ever love me especially since and i never asked her out ot told her how i felt. She isnt really the best looking girl so i didnt really have any competition but she is still far out of my range. I dont want to talk about her too much so i just will sumarise it; went to her sweet 16 where i got drunk, knocked the fuck out and left out of shame in the night. We got close again months later i (unplanned )told her that i always liked her on fucking snapchat and she said she had to think about it. She never answered and im trying to move on and focus on school and work. But i just cant i miss the one friend i always talked to about how i felt and that was always there for me now she just ignored me and broke my heart in pieces. With the stress of school i was already feeling like shit and im really lacking sleep which is making it even worse. Not being able to talk about my emotions with her or anyone else really makes everything worse and my marks and mood are going downwards very fast. I would tell my mother but she has her own problems which she already barleycan handle so that aint an option and i really hate my stepmother so not even gonna bother trying. Especially the last weeks have been tough with last grandmother dying aswell. I didnt even cry when i heard it again i put the emotions aside and now its becoming too much. Christmas and new years eve were terrible and lonely for me since i didnt get invited to anything. Ive really been considering suicide that last few years but those thoughts became more serious last months. Im gonna break sooner or later and then everything will come out and i know it can be the end of me. The last days ive been wondering why i am alive and what my purpose is on this world and if anyone would really miss me when im gone.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. 

At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. 

Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. 

I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs.

One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. 
The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way?

I'm a slow learner and went into college, very innocent and naive from a strict household. I tried to get laid but couldn't. College is easy for sex but I was struggling. I hate being a virgin. Now that college is done, I regret it and my wasted youth.

I'm slowly losing my sanity and I've had enough of being clueless. I don't know where to start I'm not getting any younger. I went from optimistic to very depressed, self hating, isolated.

Been going through abuse from my parents since 2, been depressed and numb for 20 years and bullying, I never had any friends, I got in an accident and permanently deformed. it got really bad the last 2 years, I had an autoimmune disorder. I don't want therapy, I can't afford it.

"Throwaway because my other account is related to my occupation. TLDR: sick of the grind of depression, no support system, just need to get it out.

Basically, I have no will to live. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind ceasing to exist. I‚Äôve been like this one other time in my life-when I was 15 and hospitalized for 4 weeks. During that time, however, I did want to die. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin from anxiety but at the same time,  I have zero energy or motivation to get out of bed. Recently I‚Äôve had some serious financial problems, but nothing else has changed. I have an amazing job that people dream of and thousands of people would take in a second.I live in a beautiful area of the country, and I have food to eat and a roof over my head. I have a couple friends and a boyfriend and two cats. I‚Äôm so depressed at this point that the none of this seems to matter. I just want to sleep as much as possible. 

I‚Äôve been on and off antidepressants since I was 9 years old (28 now) and it‚Äôs been 3 solid years with none. I felt good for a long time and one of the worst parts of this is knowing that at any time, for the rest of my life this can and will return. For no reason. And I worked so hard to wean off medications and it‚Äôs very discouraging to know it‚Äôs time again. 

I have a doctors apt at the end of January to ask to be put back on meds. Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. I‚Äôm also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. It‚Äôs not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. I‚Äôm  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)

I guess I just needed to get it out. And continue to analyze how I‚Äôm going to make it and function for the next 4 weeks (and then 6 weeks for full effect of meds) and I‚Äôm just sick and literally tired of the beast called depression. I know it can get better, I‚Äôm just tired of waiting.

"I've never considered I could be depressed, until very recently after speaking to a friend about her depression. 

For most of most of my life, from a teen to 33, I've had bouts of utter sadness/despair where I feel like I'm not good enough or ever will be. 

But it was always in small doses and usually I could be cheered up fairly easily. What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.

Today at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends. We've got adorable dogs.

Our social life is ok, not great (we've moved to a new city and lost touch gradually with old friends), but we're both sociable and usually never spend a week without a social activity with friends. 

I've got a decent career and make twice what someone my age usually gets. My wife and I together earn just over ¬£150K/year before taxes.

We travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.

I find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. 

It's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.

Right now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.

Now that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.

I didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.

I'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.

My best friend, the one who opened up to me about her depression, is my confidant right now and she is helping tremendously. Just knowing she understands helps.

My jawline used to be so nice and prominent before I got braces, but now it's ruined.

I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money.

Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests  and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

"I spent another birthday alone. My 30th. Not that it makes much of a differences since I have spent most days of my life alone. Not even posting in r/viriginityexchange at the last minute in the hopes of a pity fuck worked.

I am unable to pass whatever social filter that allows for normal sexual interactions.

I have laid next to two women naked in their respective beds. Neither time did I believe they were genuinely attracted to me and I am still not sure they were. I missed those opportunities to lose my virginity many years ago. Since then I have become uglier, fatter, and bald. I am so bitter and negative there is no way I will seem attractive to anyone, least of all myself.


I could blame with the conservative and severely orthodox Catholicism that taught me to hate myself and my own sexual urges. Still recovering from this. I could blame the terrible role models of relationships in my life since my parent's and family's' relationships look like stories written by Updike. I could blame my own past. Regrettably, I have to blame my own cowardice. My own hatred of myself  poisoning my veins resulting in endless pity parties and destructive hedonism. 

It doesn't matter what the causes are now. It is too late. If I ever got up the courage to ask someone on a date and by some miracle they agreed, the actual road to sexual or affectionate behavior would be so pitiful and pathetic she would doubtlessly be turned off or just laugh at my inexperience.

I am going to die a virgin and alone. Whether that death is natural or by my own actions I don't know. It won't be today or tomorrow, but the loss of having missed out on so much is unbearable.

"Hello,

Ive fallen into depression again a few months ago and it got really bad a month and a half-ish ago so i went back to therapy. I went to see the psychiatrist who prescribed me meds. Im on remergon as anti-depressant, akton for anxiety and Zopiclone Teva + ergytonyl for insomnia and nightmares. 

Ive started taking them two weeks ago. Now my question: does any of you have experience with taking those meds while smoking weed? I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea? I know that alcohol can interfere with the effect, dont know what weed will do tho and im way too anxious to just try it. 

Any opinions on the matter are welcome. Thanks! ",3,"smoking weed, taking those meds"
"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments. I just needed to say this.",1,"abusing my body, sack of pig's flesh, hating my body, repulsiveness, hate my face, horrible weight, impending shame, hate going outside"

"My depression comes and goes, for the most part I'm content and happy, I just have a bad day here and there, but that hasn't been the case over the past month or so. I've gotten drunk almost everyday the past few weeks (although I am sober writing this and have no plans to drink tonight,) I've been overeating, and I've cut back on my workouts which has caused me to put on a little weight (although I guess that's pretty normal for people around the hollidays.) 

I've also been overagrresive and snap on the littlest dumb things. I've been destroying my house, putting holes in the wall and kicking doors and cabinets. I've also been waking up in my sleep pissed off from a dream and hitting the wall. I even woke up and headbutted the wall two times in a row which makes me feel like an absolute crazy person.

This kind of behavior is absolutely not fair to my best friend who is always there for me, my dog. It scares the shit out of him, and he doesn't know how to react. It really makes me feel like shit.

The forefront of my depression I think is due to the fact that I'm lonely. I have a good close group of friends, but most of them live hours away, so were just not able to hangout too often. It just sucks having no one to hangout with in my off time. Im also longing for companionship, a relationship, just someone to be with in a romantic manor. Ideally I'd like something serious with a girl. I do get to hangout with a girl every blue moon, and I'm usually elated afterwards and feel happy, but then it goes nowhere which makes me come down pretty hard.

Which as I'm writing this I'm realizing that may be why I'm in this slump. I met this cool girl, we hungout and had a good time, and I let my hopes get up because I thought I might actually have a chance of something happening with her. But in the end it was obvious that she just wasn't that into me. Which is ok, I'm over it, looking back and getting to know her a bit more I realize that we wouldn't have been a good match. I just wish I could find girls to go out with more than once every 6 months.

I'm just really lonely, I want someone to be with so bad. Someone that I can come home to and spend time with, and cuddle, and have sex of course, but all the other stuff is so much better for me. Of course, I know I have deeper seated issues than just loneliness. I also wish I would have accomplished more in life in general by now, being 27 yrs old, but I'm not gonna get into all that.

I'm not suicidal, although I do think about it everyday, and do wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. But there's no way I could go through with it right now. I love my friends, family, and my dog too much and know it would destroy them if I was gone. I do talk about this stuff with my friends and I'm pretty open with them as far as everything I've written here. So I do have a decent support system, but there's only so much they can do.

That being said, I'm not really asking for advice, I know what I need to do to get better and I recognize my problems.

I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. 

I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements.

"Hi all.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1,"Molested, never been able to move past, impaired my ability, to form emotional attachments, even to perform sexually, workplace accident, couldn't handle the job, Lonely, in pain"

"I used to try to talk to people about my depression, and tell them how I felt. In the end it only pushed people alway. No one wants to hear about your depression and the things you go through that suck. All they want to hear about is how successful you are, the jokes you have to tell, in general, the positives you can add to their lives. If you think you've found something different I promise you, you haven't, you're just missing whatever that other person is getting out of you. 
As shitty as this sounds, once you know this, you can rearrange your behavior to reflect how people really feel. Why try and talk about your depression with someone? In the end you're really just bringing them down. It's better to focus on something positive or if you can't just make some space and don't talk about anything at all. The people people love to be around are ""always in a good mood"" or ""always down to have a good time"". Chances are these people have issues as well they probably just handle them better. They know that no one really cares about their problems, and people just want someone they can have fun with so they play them game. And when these people can't play the game anymore they spend sometime alone. Sure, maybe some people are just naturally happier than others but that doesn't mean that even naturally unhappy people can't use the same strategy. They might just have to spend more time by themselves. 

Ultimately my New Years resolution is to keep more of myself to myself, to be more positive around others even if I don't feel it within myself and most importantly, to take that time to myself to know when I can't put on the face anymore. ",5,"pushed people always, no one really cares"

"I'm jacob. I'm 16 years old and I live in Minnesota. I'm posting this because I believe I had an intense moment of clarity while I was stoned. (Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. 

    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) 

    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.

    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.

    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. 

    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.

    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.

    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.

    I wouldn't have to be throwing my life away if I don't throw it away. Please send some advice. Thanks

"Some stuff about me (don't think of it as bragging, which is shouldn't, because every other day I feel like sleeping and never waking up, so there's not much to brag about):

Studying math, CS at a good university. Doing great in school, 4.0, even accelerated some courses to get ahead a year. Did research, on bound to get into a great grad school.

Come off from a well off family. I could not work a single day in my life and live comfortably, or run our family business and easily earn 400k/yr.

Am good looking, have a girlfriend and many friends

Despite this, I'm feeling very depressed and inadequate, which is obvious since I'm writing this post 30 minutes before a new years party I'm going to.

I look around and there are people my age who are multimillionaires running successful companies, singers with millions of followers, or sons of billionaires. There are others who studied whatever math I've studied till now (enough to pass quals at most grad schools) in high school and are doing their PhD at Harvard at 20. 

How do I stop feeling inadequate compared to these people? I'm terrified at the idea that I'll live a normal life, working 9-5, getting paid well but not nearly enough and die at 75 without anyone but my family giving a shit. I know that in the end after we die, nothing matters, whether I'm the average james or some famous singer. But I don't want to waste my life being the average james, and I don't think I can do anything to change it. Thought about creating a startup, but what are the chances of it being very successful (much more than my family's current business)? Probably none.

I feel like a different person takes over sometimes and makes me feel suicidal and just generally puts me in bad situations in which I make messes upon messes. I look at myself in the mirror and don't even recognize the reflection as my own. I have to consciously fight to remember that I'm real. I get in my head a lot about how everything is subjective and nothing is real and it makes me feel so overwhelmed I could just drop dead.

I feel like I live in a sarcophagus; my face and body is the fancy lid, but inside there's this entire other existence trapped and unable to control anything that happens on the outside. 

I spend so much energy just keeping myself from killing myself that I don't have enough juice to have any sort of discipline. Then when I act without discipline, I feel so guilty and ashamed and it makes me want to kill myself more. 

I've tried to talk to therapists and all of that but no one seems to get it. They just nod their head and tell me it will get better. It hasn't. And it probably won't. I think I am just destined to be sad and eventually kill myself.

"21 (M) with severe anxiety | mild depression (probably more than I admit). 

After graduating high school I did 2 years of generals in college. I didn't get my associates but I know that I'm really close and need to get that finished up. 

Before summer semester of 2016 I dropped all my classes because I hit a wall of depression, also couldn't see the Major I was in working out, and I couldn't pick a new one. I didn't want to waste money aimlessly taking classes with expensive tuition. I am currently on a leave of absence until November when I will have to begin paying my loans back if I'm not enrolled in any courses. 

Financial Standings: March of 2017 I got a full time job (40 hours a week) making $8.50/h I got a raise and will start making $10/h this pay period and my boss said that I'll get a $1 raise in the springtime. I live with my parents and they don't accept any money so 0 expenses on that front (I try not to take it for granted, I'm really grateful to them). I have a car payment of $150/month, but I plan on paying it off by March (~$3000 left). Also car insurance is about $150 a month.. I currently have ~$2000 saved up but I owe at LEAST $10k in student loans.

Never-fucking-mind.

I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it.

I didn't get it.

She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November.

I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain.

I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts.

I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head.

"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense.

"Hello everyone

as the title says I typed this for a friend, it explains in the text why. I have a history of depression and self harm (not suicidal, just really numb when depressed) which my friend doesn't know much about, but he knows me well so he will relate instantly. 
Trickier thing is that he is really far away (he moved to GB, I am in Germany. He is going through a rough patch himself, just before christmas he got rejected by the first woman he approached after his wife died early 2014. He is mentally stable though and I am sure he'd want to know this, I am just not sure how to tell him really. I can't word this in free speech, I am not a native speaker and I want this to be as clear as can be. I do fear the text might be too much and/or weird? I have no proper judgement anymore...

here the text, I'd appreciate any help. thank you

So, first of all, I don‚Äôt expect anything from you, I just need to share with someone who I knows me well enough to understand and I need you, as a friend, to know about this in case it will get worse (no worries, this might sound overly dramatic, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal for me since I am used to it) 
A few months back I started feeling stressed and burned out without being able to put a finger on why that is since realistically I had less to do than like a year back. I explained it to myself with lack of interaction with others or dull tasks which have to be done over and over or just hormonal crap and took that for the reason why I felt mentally unstable.
I tried to work on it, made sure to get some breaks here and there, was drawing and painting and meeting with people but things didn‚Äôt get better (which I only realized a few days back)
The first time I was alarmed was when the urge to just run away for a day or two. There I realized for the first time that my mind is not sending the right signals, since I love the boys and xxx and being away wouldn‚Äôt be nice at all since I‚Äôd miss the kids for sure.
Still thinking it was an overload of work I talked to xxx, telling him all this and asking him for help (like helping out around the house, that kind of help) which he tries to to his best efforts. 
It‚Äôs still not getting better. I had a proper meltdown on my birthday and on second day of christmas, still not releasing fully what‚Äôs going on. This night I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I went to bed at 11:30, fell asleep close to 1 am and woke up around 2:15 (thank you fitness tracker for the accurate information) The baby woke me and I couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep although I tried everything that would usually help. So I laid there thinking it all through and then all kinds of bad memories popped up. You know that I have the worst memory and that I am amazing with ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù things I don‚Äôt want to remember, though they aren‚Äôt gone for good‚Ä¶ 
Not sure why the normal version of me always decides not to find a way to truly process all the stuff so this shitty version of me wouldn‚Äôt have so much to feed on but that‚Äôs how it is now. I also realized that I have a general numbness when it comes to feeling emotions, I'm never very happy or enjoy things to the fullest, nor am I really sad nor angry or anything, everything is a little muted. That I actually hate and fear the most, becoming numb and empty.
So, this leaves me where I am now. It‚Äôs not unbearable or anything, but I am afraid where‚Äôll lead to eventually. I want to be a good mum and a full functioning person‚Ä¶ 

I think I needed you to know, as I said, in case things go a lot south and I‚Äôd need your support.

"23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

Yeah, my lows are VERY low.

Now I'm back to the outgoing, relatively high achieving, sane human being that I am half of the time and it's like waking up the morning after drinking realizing how horrible and embarrassing all of your actions the night before were.

I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that.

I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.

I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out.

The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed.

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies.

Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing.

Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already.

This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation.

The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same  time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose.

I don't know what to do. I can't live for myself and I can't live for her. But dying isn't an option either right  now. My life is a giant Chinese finger trap.",2,"failed ,square one, dream career is a bust"

"I love rewatching the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy.  I love the speeches and quotes about hope, rebellion, and doing what right. I really love seeing more diversity in the cast of Star Wars, and love how the focus has shifted from magic space wizards to underdog rebels against evil empires

But it feels like the good guys in our world are losing.

Some of people in power of our government and other spheres of influence (like YouTube and the police system) are abusive and act in their own interests, forsaking the poor, the envoirnent, respect and culture, education.

It takes so much to do good yet it takes very little to do bad.  And there seems to be growing presence of ‚Äúbad‚Äù online and in real life.

Whatever ‚Äúrebellion‚Äù exists is just a bunch of people who are hurt, anger, scared, maybe even dying or having everything slowly taken away from them.  A homeless man or disabled person losing programs that can help them. An environment damaged beyond all repair.  A victim being blamed for an abusers action. Parents not accepting their children identity.  A brilliant student being deported to another country and having his dreams crushed for the rest of his life because his parents sent him to a safer country without documentation.  We lost to government that trying to brainwash us with ‚Äúalternate facts‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news‚Äù while also normalizing fascism racism abuse and bigotry. We lost to the FFC.  Hell, I lost my best friend almost a year from today.

I don‚Äôt talk about it with my friends or family - if you know me, then you would also know my family is dealing with their own toxic politics and  Bullshit...and my friends...are the only good people I have left and I don‚Äôt want to lose them...  I keep retreating back to Star Wars. I need a han, a luke, a Finn, a Rey, a leia, a resistance or a rebellion....

But it just seems like the people who make up evil empire - the abusers, the gross disrespected, the hate mobs, the uncaring and arrogant politicians- have won on all fronts.

We have no rebellion.  No resistance.  They say not to give into hate - and that love will and has always saved us.  But one day, I may not have anything or anyone left to love and life for , not if I spend the rest of my life in a world run by these kinds of evil people.

"I've been dealing with horrible anxiety and depression for the better part of 2017. I'm on a decently high dose of antidepressants now, which helped for a few months, but now I just feel like my depression is overtaking my life. I have no motivation to do anything right now. I need to clean my bedroom before I start my spring semester of school, and I don't want to just waste my break sleeping, but that's all I feel like I can do. I love to read and have been thinking about starting a blog for book reviews, which is something I'm still interested in, but I have absolutely no motivation to pick up a book or do anything except sleep or watch mindless TV. 

I guess I'm asking if anybody else has experienced this and if anybody has suggestions for how to get through this rut.

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it.
Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering.

"Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down.

My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down.

When I got home, my parents yelled at me. I went into my room at 5pm and didn't get out for dinner (hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch either). I was lying there for some time, thinking about all the mistakes I've made in the last few years. Getting an F in a class, spilling water on my laptop, cracking the screen on my phone 5 times, opening up a credit card and putting myself in $2500 debt, getting an STD after having sex with a guy who was in a relationship, drinking even though it's forbidden in religion. I have also been fighting depression since last August, because I started a graduate program with no social support and all my college friends moved away. I had an appendectomy in September. I was applying to medical schools; the application process was anxiety filled and one of the scariest things I've had to go through. I got rejected by most schools and waitlisted by a few.

While lying in bed, thinking about all of the shitty things I've done in my lifetime, I remembered I have a hook that's in the corner of my room. I had asked for the hook a few years ago so that I could get an indoor hanging chair or hanging pottery but never got around to it. I also have a chair in my room.

I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals?

I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.

"I think it‚Äôs safe to say that I‚Äôve been depressed for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I never thought of depression as a possibility for me so I always debunked these shitty feelings and sadness as ‚Äújust a bad streak‚Äù.

When I came to terms with myself and realized I had a problem, it took me a long time to open up to someone and reach out to them. I opened up to my girlfriend at the time. Fuck me was that a terrible decision.

At first she was mostly supportive but as time went on I was ‚Äútoo negative‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù or ‚Äúnever satisfied‚Äù. It was almost like she completely disregarded everything I told her. It pretty much became her being mad that I was depressed.

We hit a rough patch late in my senior year and it only added onto my self hate, my stress, my anxiety, my sadness. I felt everything at once and then I felt nothing. That night I decided I would kill myself only to be unsuccessful.

She and I talked things through and when I eventually told her what happened, she didn‚Äôt just put me down,  no. She called me a liar. The relationship didn‚Äôt last much longer than that but of course when I left I was told that ‚ÄúI should have tried harder‚Äù.

It‚Äôs been half a year since I left her and I have no regrets or wishes to have her back in my life, but fuck me I hate her. I hate her so much. I hate that she was the one I opened up to. Because of the experience I had with her, J am hateful to most people nowadays.

Every day I wake up absolutely loathing the fact that I will have people to interact with. My new friendships and acquaintances are short lived because I get so agitated I leave. I‚Äôve only come to learn that nobody gives a fuck about depression

Not a single person could be bothered that I want to kill myself or fantasize about how great it would be if I got in a fatal accident. There‚Äôs nothing but pretenders in this world that will use my death as a mean to promote themselves as a good person. I can only see myself writing a scathing note about just how much I hate everyone before I die. 

Whenever I do that, I can only hope that it hurts everyone so fucking bad. Hurt them like they hurt me

"Hello everyone,

I'm a long time lurker on this sub. Like I mentioned in the title, my life has been nothing but a mess for the last 4 years. I failed university in my last semester and never managed to finish my degree in 2013 and the entire 2014. I started working in 2015 but by early 2016 I self-sabotaged myself out of a stable job due to depression from a break up with my then girlfriend of 5 years. 

I have been living like a parasite for the last 2 years - living with my parents without paying anything. My self-esteem at the moment is so low I was about to delete this very post just because I felt bad typing all of that out.

Nights after nights I go to sleep asking myself - what do I even live for? Helpless, frustrating, disappointing, sad, angry and sometimes suicidal are probably what you'd use to describe my inner thought in recent years. 

I don't know if any of you experience this but in my mind there's this voice that constantly talks down to me. ""You're a useless piece of shit"" is probably the number one thing that it keep reminding me. I never tell my parents that I'm depressed. Or that I failed uni. Or that I had a girlfriend and broke up with her after 5 years. I lied to them when they tried to talk to me about those things. I just couldn't help it. At this point that voice in my head is probably my only friend.

I don't even know if anyone cares at this point. I'm just rambling and writing random things that probably don't make any sense. But I want to get it out somehow. I decided to not delete this post after all. 

So yeah, just want to talk about my random miserable life on the Internet with strangers for god know why. If you guys have any thing to share about your life as well I will be here reading. Probably.

"My brother in law 'has depression' and I say this because he hasn't been formally diagnosed. We live together and are quite close, but he never talks about his feelings. He went to the emergency department the other day for a panic attack and they gave him anti depressants and now he needs to see a doctor to find out what's wrong. Fair enough right, he most likely has depression/anxiety combo. 
Meanwhile he has splashed it all over facebook and messaged all of his friends. Told everyone he works with. And posted pictures of his anti depressants on facebook.
He will not stop talking about it but yet will not talk about his feelings thoughts or anything deeper than 'i went to the doctor for depression'. 
I get it if he doesn't wanna talk but everything he does makes me angry because here I am suffering in silence for the past 12 years. I finally opened up to his mum a few months ago (we're very close) about it and she's urged me to see a doctor and my boss holds me to seeing a doctor soon so I can get better and stop self harming. 
And then he turns around and pulls this shit. I finally felt like I was getting the support I needed to go and get help and he makes everything all about him. So I opened up to him about my self harm and how I've been struggling for a long long time, and he basically told me my cuts were nothing to worry about and I was clearly fine.

"I myself am clean from self-harming for almost 3 years. When I used to harm myself, I would do it in places no one could ever see, if it didn't work I used makeup to conceal even the smallest marks.However my friend's story is rather different. 

I saw my friends cuts on his arm, some weeks they are worse, some better.  The marks of cuts and bruises are extremely visible since he often wears T shirts.  Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings.

The thing is


1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?)

4th week: 10mg Celexa &amp; 150mg Effexor

"I'll try keep it brief. My younger sister and I have a good relationship, but she's never really talked to me about depression and her apparent anxiety.

My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now.

"Hi all.
This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).
I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.",4,"College, suffered , cyber anxiety, misfortune, vulnerability scared to be laughed at or attacked"

"Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem I‚Äôve had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was ‚Äúare you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?‚Äù



I kind of shrugged and laughed ‚Äúehh I don‚Äôt think so‚Äù. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup.


I told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling down, but I‚Äôm not too sure about my answer which is why I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what I‚Äôm going through.



Let‚Äôs start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I‚Äôve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they‚Äôre all headed.


I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.



I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it‚Äôs been a good year since I‚Äôve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I‚Äôd do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who‚Äôve I‚Äôve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I‚Äôve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don‚Äôt know where the time went.




Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I‚Äôm not walking around outside.





 I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I‚Äôm just watching what I eat. I‚Äôve lost a couple of pounds which is great.



My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would‚Äôve happened if my mother didn‚Äôt have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn‚Äôt take.


Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. 


I‚Äôve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.


I haven‚Äôt attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that‚Äôs good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I‚Äôm scared to know what the intent of that was.

Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn‚Äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel.

"It's 4:18 AM as I'm typing this, and I can't sleep. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, but I couldn't stop thinking and stressing about going back to work after the holidays. Before I knew it, I was about to break down and hyperventilate or cry. I didn't want to wake up my fianc√©e, so I got up and I'm now sitting in the livingroom. I'm sorry for whining when I know other people have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent.

I'm almost 30 years old, the son of the owner of a local business in a small town located in Qu√©bec, Canada. I work for his company, which deals in the sales and repair of commercial and industrial equipment. On paper, I work in sales; in reality, I do practicality everything except for repairs, including but not limited to sales, purchasing, quotations, invoicing, customer service at the counter, on the phone and online, retail item placement and management, parts and equipment research, shipping and receiving, data entry and processing, IT, webmaster, infographics and promotional materials. I also manage our team to some degree and replace the boss and our accounts receivables/payables (his girlfriend) whenever they're away, so I handle late payment complaints even though I can't do anything about it. I'm bilingual and so almost all communications in English are done through me.

That may sound like a fair bit, but I then I also do approximately 75% of one of my colleagues' work because he quite simply can't be arsed to do it. He'll act like he's super busy doing one task whereas I'm typically juggling (no joke) between 5 and 8 tasks at any time, yet I often find him playing solitaire or stretching and loudly yawning at his desk, even when customers are waiting at the counter. A couple summers ago, for two years in a row, when we were the only employees in front, he literally spent hours sleeping at his desk while I alone held the fort throughout our busy seasons. He's approaching retirement age and has been involved with the family for decades; he's not going anywhere.

The foreman in charge of managing repairs and our crew of mechanics routinely vanishes, either going out for errands that take a suspicious amount of time to run, going upstairs to do work for his own company on our dime, spending half an hour in the washroom (upstairs for some reason), running home for one reason or another, or just plain nowhere to be found for no known reason. He fails to properly submit quotations to most customers and fails to properly fill out repair files, so we have to inform customers and make out invoices at the counter when they come in. He also gets me to find parts and pricing as well as place orders for him because he seemingly doesn't feel like doing that himself, maybe because that would cut into his Facebook time. He's typically 15-30 minutes late each morning and afternoon, but he takes off at closing time on the dot, if not a few minutes early. I think it's fair to say that I effectively do about half of his job for him. He's family and is seemingly unfireable for some reason, despite the fact that he's hurting the company badly.

I'll admit I'm usually about 5 minutes late in the morning; I barely get any sleep and never feel rested from any sleep I do get, so it takes a lot of time and motivation to get up and going. That doesn't make it right and I'm ashamed of this bad habit, but I work an extra hour or two everyday, unpaid. I get paid 40 hours a week, but typically work about 50 hours a week. I get reprimanded for being late and for being sick, but unpaid hours go unmentioned. I don't have any fancy diplomas, but I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I was a hard worker, maybe even a workaholic.

My father's family is pretty well known locally and is fairly affluent, so customers tend to assume that I'm well off, but they couldn't be further from the truth. I get paid a few dollars more than minimum wage and that's it; no benefits, no commission, no overtime pay, no extra vacation days and no share of the company's profits. I make just enough for my fianc√©e and I to survive and afford necessities, and that's about it. Last winter, I couldn't even afford heating, so I had to borrow money to buy fuel oil. Meanwhile, two of my cousins had their houses custom built, one of them spends half his time on vacation with his family and the other's heading to Las Vegas soon, and my other cousin doesn't work but has all her expenditures and house paid for by her dad.

If I dare to complain about my financial difficulties, I get talked down to by my father and his girlfriend and told that I should save up (what is this concept of having leftover money at the end of the month???). They say that my fianc√©e should find work, but they don't pay her for the work she does for them. She's a self-employed web designer, artist and programmer; unfortunately, times are tough in that line of business here. She has however done thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work for them, including 3-4 professional websites, and continues to assist them. Any amount she makes goes straight to paying off our debts (credit card) or contributes to paying our expenditures.

My father wants me to buy the business from him so that he has a retirement fund that allows him to keep up his current lifestyle, which includes going on vacation abroad 4-5 times a year, not including camping trips in his RV. However, he refuses to do anything about the obvious issues currently going on and refuses to adapt to the changing market. Suggestions always get turned down and he resists any improvements that I and my only helpful colleague attempt to make. I also routinely have to put up with my father's infantile tantrums and the fact that he doesn't trust me to do anything, resorting to ""micromanaging"". Recently, he doubted my ability to read a PDF in front of a supplier, which was embarassing, and couldn't let me compare invoices (that he asked me to compare) and tried to take over my computer while I was using it so he'd show me how to do my job. It's an extremely stressful work environment, but it's also the way my father has always been with me, and I'm fairly sure that's played a large part in the fact that I have no self-confidence and can't connect with people.

The end result of all the above is that I come home late everyday, exhausted both physically and especially mentally. I barely get any real sleep, my stomach frequently gives me trouble and I suspect that's due to stress, and every little thing feels like a huge challenge. I'm under massive stress because I know very well that if any emergency occurs, if anything breaks or worse, I'm completely unable to afford to solve the issue. Instead, I have to rely on the pity of others, typically my father's if he feels like it (with a healthy dose of acting like he's being generous instead of paying me according to my work), and live with the shame of it. I've always had an exceptional patience with people, but lately the stress has been building up and I've begun snapping at people, worst of all my loving and supportive fianc√©e without whom I wouldn't even be around right now.

I've been depressive for over 15 years now and coping with it, but I think this is my lowest point yet. The last week before the holidays, I stood alone in the shipping area and slowly dug a box cutter knife into my left wrist. I was, quite literally, an inch away from ending my life, but it barely left a mark and looks like a skin fold now. I don't want to leave my fianc√©e and our cats though, and I especially don't want them to end up in financial trouble. I have a life insurance, but the payout is minimal and they wouldn't cover suicide before at least another year and a half.

I'm going back to work on Monday, less than a week from now. At this point, I only see a few ways out...

- Winning the lottery: Essentially a miracle, but also our only hope of fulfilling any dreams or projects.

- Leaving: Taking a massive risk and leaving my current job, hopefully to work from home online, possibly burning bridges with a family that I do care for despite it all, but also possibly losing everything.

- Staying: Try to last another year and a half in this situation and then examine my options, possibly a rope.

It's now 7:06 AM as I'm typing this on my phone, still sitting in the livingroom. I've stopped panicking and am shaking instead. If you've read this whole thing, I feel sorry for taking that time away from your life and for whining so much, but I'm also thankful that you cared enough to finish. I'm not looking for a solution, I simply needed to vent.

That said, please hit me up if you're looking for someone to work online remotely.",5,"Sleep, never feel rested, reprimanded, sick, exhausted, physically, mentally"
"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1,"going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof "

"I'm 18 and have never really been able to make any friends.  I spent this new year alone again.

Hearing about my parents talking with old school friends about who used to go out with who, and asking me how my 'love life' is going keeps reminding me of how unlikely it is I'm ever going to function in society.  My parents met and started going out when they were younger than me and I'm still a virgin.

My ssris don't cure my loneliness and only help in a superficial, enough energy to get out of bed sort of way.

Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13.  I just don't see anything to look forward to in life.  Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours.  Even youtube sucks now.

I'm so sleep deprived and lonely, hopefully I'll just die from a heart attack or a stroke or something.

I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong, it seems to come to most people so naturally - socialising - but I guess I'm just not one for life.",4,never really been able to make any friends
"So i'm visiting another city with my friends, i knew upfront most of them would be couples and us single folks would be in minority, but what the hell, right?

I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. 

The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. 

So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason.

Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do? Even if they are the only ones, why do I feel so bad? What‚Äôs wrong?",1,feel so unloved even though they do
"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

"Today is my birthday, it's supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be happy. But thing didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others, then my dad blamed it on me. I didn't care but tomorrow I have finals, I'm already stressed out enough. I wanted to go to a library or a coffee shop to study and forget all about this shit, but then my dad pointed at me and said that if I dared to go out I'm out forever. My mom told me to go my room (she's with me, she cares for me and she doesn't want me get hurt). So I went to my room. Inside, I still heard my dad blaming me for the nuisance I didn't ask for. I grabbed my phone and typed ""Thank you"" to all the texts my friends sent me to wish me a happy birthday. I tried to keep myself positive. 
But then the feelings just hit me hard. It was like a switch. The second after that, I already felt the water all over my face as I threw the glass on the floor. 
I felt...satisfied. The inside of me screamed ""Yes, you did it!"". I played safe with all my life, as the sweet little girl I was. But I know my emotions are unstable and my mental is crumble as hell. I never had the gut to do that, I've always swallowed all the hatred and sadness. So this time instead of crying and writing down all the sadness, I actually did something to show it. Of course my parents went to my room immediately. My mom didn't say much but my dad kept saying how disappointed he was. My dad had a perfect picture of a standard family which the females are always gentle and never fight back. So this incident must make him consider me a failure or something like that.
As I cleaned the mess, he just kept talking. Now he blamed it on my mom that she didn't raise me as a good obedient girl. It made me feel maybe I shouldn't have been born at all. I couldn't tell him that before I'm a girl, his daughter, I am a human. I have emotions. I'm not some doll to bend for his liking. 
I love my dad, I know he love me back too. But the difference between the ideal daughter of him and the actual me is miles away.  
I felt like because of the relationship between me and my family I'm living like a switch. I lost interest in living, I don't see the point of moving on. After all, my life will be a boring cycle. I'm scared that someday I will be crazy enough to actually end my life since I always have that thought at the back of my head. Today I already made the first step. I'm constantly pushed and pulled between living a normal life and depression. 
Tomorrow will be very awkward and stiff, I don't know how to face my family and tell them that I'm really crazy and dead inside.
Maybe I'm truly not suitable for living. For all the achievements and love I get, I still feel so empty. Nothing matters. I love some Kpop idols to learn to love someone wholeheartedly and think that they would love me back. It soothes my poor soul and I have someone to think of instead of thinking about my life. But I know it's just me finding reasons to continue living on.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess..

"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends).  I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things.  I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit.  My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone.

Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP.  However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time.  Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects.

"Hi,
My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government.

It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

"Everything has just gone pear shaped. I had a great year on the whole, things really started to look up until they came crashing down. My mental state has been in decline for a few months and it's finally culminating in the destruction of everything good in my life. 2018 is shaping up to be utter dog shite.
I can't even tell the story, it is so complicated and spans over 3 years. It's all becoming too much and I really just want out. I don't even want to end it all, I just want to start again. I'm about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw. I walked out to the bridge last night, I really wanted to do it but on the way I talked myself out of it. It felt like as I walked there I left the reality that was torturing me and then as I approached my house on the way back, all the anxiety and fear and pain started to kick back in. I just got back in and cried for hours. My just-about-still girlfriend spoke to me and managed to level me. Today I'm back to square one where I think she's going to leave me, I can tell she wants and she should after that way I've treated her recently. I took my problems out on her and treated her terribly. I'm getting my just deserts. 
When she leaves me, I'll fail my exams, drop out and who knows. I don't know how I'm going to cope. My life was once so good.",4,about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it.

When you look into the abyss

And the abyss looks into you,

Penetrating, objective,

He analyzes your insides

and devours your name.


----------------------------


But sometimes, only sometimes,

when you look into the abyss,

He ignores you, threes not even silence.

And nothing happens at all.


----------------------------


You would give all to the abyss,

just to get devoured by him,

Annihilation is all you ave left,

but even the abyss doesn't care about you.


----------------------------


Desperate, you cry:

‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù

Please, I just want to hear a voice.

It does not matter if it is true or not,

I just need an answer,

because that would mean I am something,

to someone.



----------------------------
However, the only thing you can hear,

is the silence in past conversations.

----------------------------


You cry, and emptiness conquers you,

the beauty of your words no longer matters,

if not even the abyss hears them.

----------------------------


Everything looks so simple, 

filling my emptiness would be so simple‚Ä¶


----------------------------

I just need to be answered,

be something to someone,

be mentioned, praised or even insulted,

But be called.

----------------------------


Only then,

When even the abyss abandoned me,

I discovered the formula to smile again.


----------------------------

And you feel the taste of a tear,

that has slipped into your tongue,

Cached by a smile.

"I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. 

I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. 

So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.

I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. 

If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through.

Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression!
I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room.

However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health.

"I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me:

I am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.

Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.

But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it.

I don‚Äôt want any of those to happen.

"On New Years Eve, I was so convinced that I was going to spend it alone. And I was going to end my meaningless life on new year. 

I ended up spending it with my boyfriend, who made me realised that I was actually cared for, and loved, and gave me a chance at believing that I would have a future in front of me. Letting someone be the reason for me to live isn't going to be good in the long run, but as for now, it's good enough. I actually want to stick around and see what happens. Maybe it's going to turn out fine, and not as bad as my thoughts were telling me. 

He held my face and made me look into his eyes. He whispered that he loves me and didn't want me to leave. He said that he will never ever find anyone else.

Having said that, i'm always scared and anxious that I won't have the strength to fight my demons. I know that he would always be there for me and not let me fight my battles alone.

"2017 was a terrible year. I dealt with a horrible breakup. Depression and anxiety symptoms that had been held in check for a while became really bad. I lost a friend to suicide. I had my closest friends move away. I had physical health issues to deal with. I had some troubles at work.

The worst part of the year was that my dog got sick twice, and the second time was cancer. Like a lot of people, my dog has helped me through some really tough times. She's been the only reason I've gotten out of bed some days. I've had her for over 11 years. Six months ago she had some aggressive and expensive surgery to treat the cancer and it (seemingly) worked. She recovered well and is back to being her old high-energy self. The last couple of months I have felt so much better because she has too. 

Last week I found a lump on the site of her surgery. I'm waiting to see a specialist, but I'm devastated. If the cancer has returned I don't know if it will be treatable this time. I don't know if I can afford more surgery.

I'm not stupid - my dog is 11, and I know realistically she will only be around another couple of years at best. But I can't imagine life without her, especially now. I don't know how to handle her being sick again and potentially suffering. I can't handle her dying. I can't handle her being gone.

If you're not a pet person, you probably don't understand this, but for 11 years I've always had at least one thing that loved me and relied on me. She's kept me going and I don't know what to do without her. Thanks for listening.

"Hi guys, I was just wondering whether any of you have been in this state of mind because. I can't find anything when I google it. 

I am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.

 I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. 

Despite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. 

She was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. 

Without her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. 

I don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?

Thanks for any responses. ",3,addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs

I want to hear you, let's talk about it.",1,"about depression, anxiety and stress "
"
I'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I've had mental health issues for a while, but it has really worsened since about August of this year. I was actually having a pretty good summer, I travelled in Europe with my best friend, saw a cousin who lives in Germany and had a fun week in Paris. It was exciting and really nice. I miss those days. It feels like forever ago. I started feeling weird about a week after I got back. I kept sleeping and sleeping, so much sleep, but I was never rested... I felt tired all the time and always had a headache. My thoughts were really morbid and weird. I kept thinking about my own death, my cat's death, my parents' death... they recently turned 50, they hopefully have many years left of healthy life, but I'm scared to lose them. I started thinking about how life is so temporary and we're moving rapidly along a path toward that inevitable end, each day closer to a painful illness and death... and endless nothingness after that.
So I started college in September. I'm minoring in philosophy, and I'm taking this course called Ancient Philosophy. The professor is great. But the thing is, philosophy and astronomy are the two topics that really get me into these disturbing existential thoughts. We're reading a lot about death, and I wrote this paper about Epicurus' views on death (he is the one who said ""death is nothing to us""). I found it interesting. I realized that I somehow long for death (most of my problems arise from consciousness, and I find it very appealing to just go to sleep forever and never wake up, because I find the most comfort in sleep and am always disappointed to find myself waking up to another lousy day on earth). At the same time, the idea of ""eternal nothingness"" really creeps me out, probably because I can't imagine it and because consciousness is all I have ever known. I missed a lot of class and was late a lot this semester because I just didn't... see the point, I guess. Of doing anything. I thought about killing myself just to get it over with. I know how I'd do it and everything. I really think I will kill myself someday. I honestly am about 75% sure that my life will end in suicide; not any time soon, but eventually. I actually like the idea of suicide. In a way, I am pro-suicide for myself (I would never encourage anyone else to do this, but it's their choice). I find the idea of dying by suicide empowering because something inevitable and daunting is now put into my hands, and I control my own death as well as my own life. I told a friend this once, needless to say my friend was not amused and got worried. I don't talk to anyone about it now, they shouldn't have to worry about me, I just wonder if my thoughts are really abnormal psychologically or if that's rational (it seems rational to me, and it seems like people just think it's ""crazy"" because of the prevailing view in society that suicide is always both immoral and irrational).
I can't really talk to my parents about this. They don't believe in mental illness. I'm from a Syrian Druze family, but they're very secular and don't care about religion... and I've always found religion to be just a way of getting out of actually evaluating the world and confronting the absurdity of life. And I sort of have a negative view of it because of the destruction that fundamentalism has brought to a lot of people, it's close to the experience of people where I'm from, all for an irrational idea. At the same time I have always been a bit jealous of people who have religion to rely on. Like some of my Muslim friends or ones who are very Christian. They know God is there for them. I don't have anyone or anything. I don't know if I'm depressed. I definitely have been, but at the moment I'm fairly active, but my thoughts are never on what I'm doing, they're always on these existential problems and I'm almost always feeling despair and hopelessness, even when I'm acting social and trying to have a good time.
I sometimes feel that the world is not real, and worry that it will disappear at any moment. It feels that I am in a dream. I cannot define myself and others always seem like strangers, no matter how close a relationship we may have. Everything seems absurd to me. People I know from school and from my job are always are sighing about essays, exams, homework, work. To me it seems so strange. It seems like people act as though we are not mortal. They don't act like they are aware they will die. In the supermarket or something, I feel an urge to remind everyone ""We are temporary! We will not always exist!"" (Of course, I don't).
My life circumstances aren't bad, I've had some difficult things, like I lost a few family members and a friend from childhood. But overall, I should be grateful. My family has money, I've never had to face poverty. My parents love me, but don't understand me. I love them, but don't relate to them. I hope I don't seem ungrateful. I don't understand why I am how I am.

"I am a 21 y/old male currently in my final year of university in the uk however I still live at home. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 due to my upbringing and circumstances.

I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness which meant at school I always felt different to everyone else and as such have kept my personal life extremely private. Even though I decided to leave the religion at the age of 16, a large number of my family remain in this religion. I've always therefore struggled to live a 'normal' life, and my small circle of friends still have no idea of my past.

Due to this, relationships with girls especially and making new friends is something I always avoid due to fear of them and everyone else finding out about me. Because of this, I've never had a girlfriend. When I keep to myself and get my head down and focus on university work I can usually put the anxiety to one side, however recently I met a girl who I like and she likes me and it's causing me great anxiety and depression again. She's always telling me about how close she is with her family and not only can I not relate, it annoys me I can't be the same.

I think it has a lot to do with me caring about what people think of me too much as I'm aware of people who left the religion in similar circumstance and have normal relationships and seem to not care.

I like this girl yet she's so opposite to me as she's really outgoing and how normal she is makes me scared she'll only think I'm weird when she gets to know me.

"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.

Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead.

I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this.

Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road.",5,"both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver"
"All that I've been able to feel is beginning to turn into feeling nothingness. Even when depressed there are still ups and downs but now I am starting to just feel nothing. Blandness. Stale. Everything devoid of any meaning really at all. I'm not suicidal and I don't self-harm. There's just no motivation to accomplish anything and I can't really see the point of anything. I find myself staring at things and thinking about nothing, whereas my mind used to spend a lot of time thinking about everything. Does anyone else feel like this? Sometimes, like now, I realize it's happening and it makes me feel worse to know it's happening but sometimes it really doesn't even bother me because sometimes feeling nothing can be better than feeling anything, ya know? I don't know.",5,"just no motivation to accomplish anything, can't really see the point of anything"
"I'm 19, F and I absolutely hate my parents. They are the worst. All my mom does is take out her anger on me and criticize me. She is extremely judgemental in every single aspect that relates to me. But they treat my brother like he is the golden child. He sexually abused me and let his friends do it too. He can not to do anything wrong. My parents are ready to buy him a brand new car, but won't let me have gas money for the car that's already at home.
My parents honestly treat my brother with so much love and support and it breaks my heart to see them treat me like I'm some unwanted part of their life. 
They have told me multiple times that I should grateful because they feed me and provide for my education, like that isn't the responsibility of parents? They make it seem like it's a great and big deal that I'm not abandoned. They treat me like a slave and I get in trouble if I don't do anything they tell me to do.
I honestly hate every single moment I stay at home. My parents and my brother always gang up on me and ruin my mood constantly.
I have seriously considered suicide in the past to get away from this hell and I still live with them. But I have realised that is too easy for them. I don't want to end my life because of some assholes. I'm gonna study my ass off, get a good job enough to allow me to live on my own and never look back again.

"Cannot believe I am here. I am entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted. I am not suited to bear the burden of existence, the ebb and flow of life which inevitably contains suffering. Life is a beautiful golden package containing pure cyanide . Life is an atomic bomb decorated with glitter. To whom can I return this ""gift""? Where will I find my home? It's unreachable. Not even the hands which were once warm and comforting can accommodate me now. In death I find comfort, an unparalleled feeling of Liberation. Like Hal [Infinite Jest] I find myself at a crossroads between the desire to pursue a better life and the desire to succumb to my addiction entirely. Really, my desire is to escape. I am seeking an El Dorado which doesn't exist. All I want is the life of a hedonist without the repercussions, the drugs and sex minus the consequences. But in reality drugs are a destructive force (not to mention illegal) and nobody I would have sex with wants anything to do with me (understandable). I feel like a prisoner to life, trapped here against my will without the means to escape. I don't want a job, I want to be able to live without needing to sustain myself. I wish I were attractive enough to convince a child free lesbian millionaire to marry me. That way I could live a life of luxury, opulence and self indulgence, and while it certainly wouldn't be fulfilling, it would be better than this.  My soul is tainting the Earth and the Earth is tainting my soul. It's a reciprocal cycle of madness. I am unsuited to life and there is really only this issue at the bottom of everything. It is the mother. Mother. That horrible word, that vile, putrid thing. I do not hate my own mother. I simply resent her decision to give birth to me and the laws which enabled it to occur.  I wish euthanasia was legal for depressed individuals. Wretched sons of bitches, forcing me to live a life I resent.. and for what? So I can be another miserable wage slave. ",2,entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted
"So I‚Äôve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I‚Äôm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I‚Äôll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn‚Äôt want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I‚Äôve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can‚Äôt wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I‚Äôm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I‚Äôll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again. I have tried over the break to strengthen myself again and not go down the same route of trying to commit to things I don‚Äôt want to do etc this time but I‚Äôm not sure. 

How would you have done it?

"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second. I still try to do helpful things for others, but lately it's made me feel more horrible than good.",5,They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them

I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and don‚Äôt have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression.

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don‚Äôt feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can‚Äôt hear it), and sometimes I don‚Äôt make any facial expressions so people think that I don‚Äôt like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don‚Äôt want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like ‚Äúdo it, stab them in the neck‚Äù or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can‚Äôt put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can‚Äôt remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.

"I'm warning you, this is gonna be a looooong ass post. This will probably get lost in this sub but there are a few things I really need to get off my chest. Also, I'm not a native speaker so baer with me :D 


2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. 


I started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. 


I dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this ""life"". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. 


After a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me ""there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect"". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.


Up until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. 


I'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.

"Hello!

I am a 23 year old female that has struggled with anxiety her whole life. I have taken many things but nothing really ""fixed"" me. Xanax and similar drugs just slowed my thoughts but didn't give me the courage or confidence to engage. Antidepressants never helped enough to notice. 

The only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol. I felt I could speak clearly and engage with all types of people. I had confidence and just loved life. But obviously I can't drink every day nor do I like drinking really.

Depression has always been on and off for me. When I don't have a lot going on I get depressed. I was also pescribed an anti depressant for my migraines from the age of 15-18. I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.

I also have a stupid past of abusing ""rave drugs.""  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)

I currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..

Extremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to ""seem normal"" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.

My anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going ""blank"" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.

This unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.

I hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. 

Can someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested.

"I‚Äôm in a dark, deep pit in the ground. It‚Äôs deep enough so I can just barely here the outside world up above me, but not much. There‚Äôs a ladder too. Sometimes, I climb up the ladder to peek out of the pit and see what‚Äôs going on outside. But usually when I do, it starts pouring rain, or a storm starts heading for me. I feel it in my stomach. A lurching, swaying pendulum that swings back and forth. It swings, and I fall down the ladder. I remember that I haven‚Äôt earned the outside world. I remember that the people out there hate me and rightly should. I remember how selfish it was of me to climb the ladder in the first place as if the world out there wanted anything to do with me.

sometimes it swings a different way, and I feel angry. Angry at myself for not just leaving the pit altogether and facing the world bravely. Angry at the people who hurts me. The pendulum has so much momentum, it slams into my stomach, sending me tumbling off the ladder again, and I hit the freezing cold dirt at the bottom. But I should‚Äôve known better, no one up there cares about me unless they‚Äôre somehow benefiting from my being around. When I run out of shoulders to be cried on, spare bedrooms for people to stay in, home-cooked food or money, I‚Äôm dispensable. No, less than dispensable- a nuisance. A fly in someone‚Äôs car, or gum on someone‚Äôs shoe. I want to scream but the outside world can‚Äôt hear me, just as I can barely hear them.

Sometimes, people come by the pit and drop in food as if I were a zoo animal. But I like the food. It helps, and when my stomach is full the pendulum has no room to swing. I feel brave again, climb the ladder up out of the pit, and sometimes I even camp outside the pit with a fire and tent, and sometimes people have fun being with me, I think.

The food comes in little orange bottles with strange names but it still helps. It makes it easier to breathe if I do fall into the pit again.

(No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.)

2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do.

(Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.)

3.) Poverty level.

(Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.)

4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc.

(Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.)

I really hate school, not because I'm not smart or anything, but I just have to go and see people who actually have friends/people who care about them. I go to a Catholic school and I don't believe in god so every time they pray I feel like laughing at them which just illustrates how awful I really am.

I really don't see why anyone would try to become friends with me because I have super shitty social skills, which I happened to inherit from my parents. I've been to a psychologist and it really didn't help. I have one person who I can really talk to but I want to not have to because I feel like I'm just dragging her down with me whenever I talk about how much I hate my life.

I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart internally. I constantly have a pain in my chest from the sadness. I‚Äôve lost all my motivation and have to convince myself to get out of bed. I frequently look through the medicine cabinet and google how much of all the medications i would need to take to overdose. I‚Äôve cut my thigh before and I‚Äôve starting cutting my wrist, but not deep enough to scar.

I have passions, I have hopes. I want to start an Etsy store and make crafts. But I feel like it would never work.

I‚Äôm just absolutely miserable right now. But I‚Äôm really good at masking it. I told my mom the other night that I didn‚Äôt feel safe because I was so sad and she told me I‚Äôd be fine and left the room. I stayed up all night considering sneaking out and jumping off a bridge.

"What do you think makes you feel depressed? What makes you feel suicidal? What stops you from attempting it? What do you do to find peace? What keeps you going?

I've had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings. One day when I was younger everything just hit me at once, a family member I was close to just up and left, this left me feeling alone, I also met a girl which at the time I couldn't fully comprehend what I felt for her but she was messed up to from family and all I could really do was cry about my life because I never had anyone I could really talk to about what caused me pain. Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. 

Right now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.

Idk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",4,had depression for awhile mainly caused by an unstable family/home and never addressing my issues or feelings

"I can't bring myself to enjoy anything social anymore. I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others.

"i just really need to get this out, i feel so much guilt and shame.

a friend of mine that i was once really close with (and shared romantic feelings and moments with over the years) killed himself two nights ago.

we had a stupid fight late 2015 and it wasn't until mid 2016 we finally apologised to each other and made amends. he had bipolar, he was always very open about it. i struggle with depression and anxiety. when we started talking again, i had not long broken up with a partner and was taking it really hard and trying to cope by abusing drugs and alcohol - i was not in a good place. he was very manic, immediately leaning very heavily on me and wanted to see me. he was also recently heartbroken.

i felt pressure and after our time apart was, in all honesty, thrown off by his intensity and made excuses not to see him. 

we caught up a couple of months later and again, he was very manic. but he was the same person i knew and loved and i was happy to be with him again. however that night we were drinking and popping pills, and we were heavily flirting. after a tender moment he kissed me and he wanted to start things up with me, to 'give us a shot'. telling me how beautiful i was and that we always had a connection etc. i got awkward and avoided him for a while after that. he made attempts to hang out with me and i avoided and made vague excuses.

the next couple of months i culled my social media (i was really weird and anxious about my privacy) and deleted anyone who wasn't in my immediate circle at that time, which included my friend. when he realised, he was hurt and we fought. 

he told me how much he had been struggling, dealing with suicide hotlines... i stood my ground, told him he was too intense... looking out for number one, i forgot to listen and care about my friend who just wanted support and someone to be by his side.

we made plans to hang out at a friends house around 7 months ago. he was, again, manic and abusing his prescription drugs. i was concerned, but mostly irritated at his intensity. we however left with a hug and on good terms.

7 months later he killed himself.

this post is all over the place and doesn't do our relationship justice, i am focusing on the fights we had and the ways i let him down because they are all i can think about. i feel so horrible and guilty. struggling with my own depression, i should have been there for him.

"This is my first time on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if my post doesn‚Äôt meet the rules. I‚Äôve just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. 

A month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didn‚Äôt want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I can‚Äôt leave work for that long. I‚Äôll just get that much further behind. 

That hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.

Except I don‚Äôt want to keep going anymore. I‚Äôm not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. I‚Äôm so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. 

I‚Äôm 23 now. In the almost 5 years since I‚Äôve been diagnosed, I‚Äôve had 5 crisis events that I‚Äôve had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. 

Normally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I can‚Äôt. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs different about this time. 

My counselor (social worker? Therapist? What‚Äôs the appropriate term?) says that I‚Äôm depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says I‚Äôm scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my ‚Äòdisability.‚Äô Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I don‚Äôt tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I don‚Äôt allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. 

I‚Äôm not comfortable with that. I don‚Äôt know how I really feel. I don‚Äôt want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I can‚Äôt protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when I‚Äôm in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when I‚Äôm too weak to stand by myself. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I can‚Äôt be emotionally weak too. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do about my therapist. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone you‚Äôve only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like there‚Äôs a line that‚Äôs been crossed and it‚Äôs not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing any of this right. 

My symptoms are getting worse. I didn‚Äôt know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now it‚Äôs in my arms and legs and it‚Äôs hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didn‚Äôt realize how hard it would be to wait. I didn‚Äôt realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.

I just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I don‚Äôt want to be strong anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so courageous for dealing with this.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be. I just want to sleep.

"I'm in a perpetual state of worsening pain and improving ability to just keep on going regardless. At this point, I don't think my mind can be broken. I'm not sure that's a good thing.

I'm only 23 and I'm in constant fear of dying from my body refusing to take any more stress (traditional blacksmithing as a long-term goal, construction type work to afford to pursue it, both are pretty hard on the body) without any semblance of motivation to do so or happiness as a reward.

"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline.

For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression.

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most.

I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken.

And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me.

Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to.

"Some background information:

My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.

When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.

In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they weren‚Äôt there for me so I lost them as well. 

I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didn‚Äôt feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. 
Making friends has been difficult, I notice I‚Äôve been having trust issues and I don‚Äôt let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other people‚Äôs activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away.

**Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what they‚Äôre doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I don‚Äôt like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.**

I feel lost but I know I want to be in a better place. The solutions might be simple but my emotions are clouding my judgment. I know this was long but I appreciate any help or advice. Thank you in advance.

So,

It doesn't correlate to events in my life, 

or to my ""actual"" feelings, 

or to my physical health. 

So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? 

The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things?? What went wrong for me to be otherwise so successful, but suddenly want to die? 

Why does no one know what causes depression???????

 For those with inexplicable depression, what's your favorite theory?

"I experienced intimidation at school, and my story will undoubtedly be different from what you have read in the past.

Because I am psychopathic by definition - diagnosed by few psychiatrists - what I have learned from that encounter will help you see intimidation from a different perspective.


**The story**

When I was younger - in high school - two famous guys from the volleyball team tried to bully me.

They would laugh at anything I would do, and others followed;  most are easily influenced because of a lack of critical ability, after all.

They cursed, started rumors, and shouted insults to make sure the others and I heard them.


**Indifference**

I have learned a lot from these episodes. I have watched them go through all kind of emotions, and it was easy to see they needed to fill a void.

My utter and complete indifference made it worse.  I did not give the attention they were seeking so severely. I witnessed their behaviors toward me without any concerns; I was only interested in learning more about human interactions.

You can learn from every experience in your life, good or bad, only if you take the time - and the required energy - to interpret why the reasons the experiences happened.


**The crowd**

At that time, I expected they would go further with their intimidation - after all, they had not gotten what they wanted; and they did not disappoint.

The larger of the two guys got physical - he had to - words were useless. From my perspective, and judging from his facial expression, it seemed like he pushed me as hard as he possibly could. Then, my back hit the wall, and I fell on the floor right after.

What followed was phenomenal. Everyone that I could see from my vantage point stopped talking. They had that dramatic look in their eyes; they were eager to see how I would react.

Fantastic, because it was a real representation of how limited most humans are. What happened is unquestionably unacceptable in the eyes of the majority of people - and yet - only one person, out of almost fifty, reacted with what looked like genuine empathy.

The rest did not move an inch to help. They watched, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. Some out of fear, but the vast majority were just thrilled to witness a possible act of violence.


**You are in control**

What I have learned, and still find useful to this day, is that nearly everyone you encounter in your life is not worth your time, and even less so, your energy. Even if they're not, you need to be respectful with your entourage: it's a necessity to thrive in any society.

You are in control of who you accept in your inner circle; thus you have the courtesy of choosing wisely. From my experience, only one out of fifty should be considered investing your time with.

It was out of the question I would react the way they expected it - I had to see how they would respond if I didn't do anything. Thus, I got back on my feet and continued on my journey.

They didn't cross the line because I still had to learn. I required a code to make sure I could live socially - it is the interpretation of these experiences that would allow me to build its foundations.

That one person who stood out of the group, and who later explained everything to the authorities - made me realize she was worth investing the time.


**You are the strong one**

If you are bullied, feel intimidated, and/or rejected: it is imperative you realize, right now and from now on, you are the strong one. The ones who intimidate you would never be able to withstand - even for a second - what you are going through. 

They are weak, and unlike you, they don't have the strength to control their most elementary feelings. It is fundamental to understand that very few people have the tenacity you possess. You have an attribute that makes everything achievable: self-control.

When you think about it, is there anything else you can control entirely besides yourself?


**The necessity to talk to someone**

It is useless to let these bullies intimidate you one more time. Use your strength, which very few possess, but you do. Remember to talk to someone about it. Take the time to look around you - it is mathematical - there is one person out of 50 in your entourage who will be worth your time, who is willing to listen to what you have to say, and who is going to stand up for you.
It is your responsibility to give that opportunity to that person. Use your strength to talk to someone and share how you feel; you will be surprised how much it will help.

You also have to acknowledge you are not alone. Others feel the same and are enduring the same situation. While all situations are different, inevitably, the solutions are all alike.

To those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is.

One good start for you to display real strength - let's face it, you need it - is to apologize. If you still believe that intimidating others is a display of power, try the opposite.


**We want to hear your story**

You are all welcome, whoever and wherever you are, to share how you feel and what's on your mind with all of us, in a place where respect is fundamental.",4,"those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is"
"I graduated from a good US with a masters in mechanical engineering. I watch a lot of my peers who cheated their way through grad school get jobs and a decent salary. I have been struggling to find a job since I graduated in May 2017. I am an international student and have not seen my family in three years. 

Today is my birthday, I am alone with no one at home, because all my friends can afford to go for trips. I got three birthday wishes, My parents and a close friend. 

I do think about suicide, but i am not going to do it, I have worked too hard to throw it all away. I am a good hardworking guy who means well. Sometimes, when i see my peers who cheated on tests work for companies like Amazon, I wonder to myself, if I should also get a chance at happiness. I have been so lonely and depressed that I honestly forgot how it feels to be happy!

"I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I do know that ever since October 12th my emotional state has progressively gotten worse. I don't know how much detail we are meant to go into, but that day was I suppose, borderline traumatic... I still remember it vividly. Crying on and off afterwards. 

Since then, I've had okay days where I was relatively happy. There's days when I don't cry, and others where I cry a few times... 

I don't have that much self confidence... I draw and I'm supposively smart, considering my 4. 0 GPA, but... I guess I just compare myself to people. 
I'm not smart, my brother is way smarter. 
I'm not a good artist, just an amateur trying their best. 
I'm not pretty, I have pimples and I don't smile enough. 
I have thoughts like that... People are their own worst critic, right?... but, I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'm overly sensitive, I've noticed. If anyone yells at me or nitpicks my flaws, I'll go off and cry, or at least feel like crying. An insult isn't enough to hurt me much, it's when its personal, Especially when it's my close family and friends saying it.... 

I've almost lost my best friend twice over arguments we had. She's clinically depressed. I can't help her. But I keep trying. During the first argument, I experienced my first and hopefully last panic attack. I've had more common anxious feelings sense. Both times I sobbed for many, many minutes. The pain and worry was unbearable. I didn't want to lose her because of something I did, especially. 

I often blame myself for the things that go wrong. I apologize a lot. I'm too irritable. I'm always tired. It seems like my memory has gotten worse. I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises. My drawing hobby, talking with friends, and the internet are mostly the only things that make me happy. But it never lasts. I just wish it would... 

I am a Christian and so are my parents. I try and bring up my feelings with my mother but she insists that it's hormones and I should pray more. I thought she'd understand because of what her life had been like. I thought she'd understand since she's experienced anxiety and depression first hand. Again, I don't know if I have anything wrong with me. I haven't been anywhere. I've asked her to take me somewhere but she says I'm being a hypochondriac and believing myself into a depression. I don't think so. I just want to not hurt, is that so much to ask for? I love her, but I wish she would understand.... 

I've been sensitive to arguments since an argument began this whole ordeal and has caused problems in my closet friendship. 

I also suspect social anxiety is a possibility, but I'm really not a professional. I don't know, I just know that it effects my social life in several ways. 

When I get sad, as I often do when I'm not distracted, it hurts a lot. Physically, too. Like.. In my chest or stomach. It hurts so much. I can't handle it very well, or anything for that matter. 

I don't believe I'm suicidal, but... There have been the occasional thought of wanting to die. I'm not sure though. I want to live. But... Not like this. Not suffering... 

Anyways, here's my rambling about my feelings. If you guys could help me understand them better and maybe give advice, I'd appreciate it. 

Thank you for your time. ",5,"often blame myself for the things that go wrong, I apologize a lot, I'm too irritable, I'm always tired, It seems like my memory has gotten worse,I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises"
"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",5,There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered

Even if there is one out there that works for me, it could takes years of trial and error before I find it.

"I‚Äôve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and I‚Äôm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasn‚Äôt really helped.

I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didn‚Äôt help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I don‚Äôt remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant it‚Äôs like I wasn‚Äôt really asleep.

Idk if that makes sense but I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and it‚Äôs so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and it‚Äôs messed up. 

I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and that‚Äôs kinda made me miserable. I don‚Äôt wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed.

"Hi there. 

I‚Äôm a 24 yo lady newly married to my best friend. We rent a nice house, have two great dogs (and a grumpy cat), and I have a steady job that I normally find challenging and rewarding. 

But I‚Äôm still depressed. I can‚Äôt remember a time when I wasn‚Äôt. 

My father abused me as a child and I‚Äôve been raped as an adult (before I met my husband). Lately (as in within the last three months), I‚Äôve been experiencing really weird symptoms that are hard to explain. It‚Äôs like my mind is disassociated from my body and I‚Äôm a robot. I see the world through a pane of dirty glass and I‚Äôm not really in control of anything. I see things that aren‚Äôt there (but I realize isn‚Äôt reality), like my hands seeming smaller than usual. I‚Äôve googled those symptoms and, surprisingly, depersonalization disorder popped up.

I also have a lot of anxiety (I‚Äôve been previously diagnosed with GAD), and have panic attacks probably three or so times a week. 

I often (daily) have flashbacks of being abused and raped, and am easily triggered by hearing certain words or seeing certain items. I relive those horrors at least once a day. 

My husband knows of my past and is very supportive. I feel so guilty when I‚Äôm not able to get out of bed on my days off of work to do house chores and such, even though he doesn‚Äôt make me feel that way. He says it‚Äôs okay, but he wants me to see a therapist because it‚Äôs hard for him to see me like this. 

I‚Äôm working on seeing a therapist, but I‚Äôm very anxious about it. I‚Äôve seen a few therapists before and I feel like they either A) didn‚Äôt help or B) helped, but talking about my issues brought up a lot of bad memories I‚Äôd forgotten/blocked out. Reliving those memories made me so depressed last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward, which was so awful. I don‚Äôt want to be in a place like that again. 

Lately, I‚Äôve been making huge mistakes at work because of my inability to focus. I‚Äôm trying really hard every day, but I still end up making mistakes. It‚Äôs very frustrating when I see all my effort and hard work isn‚Äôt enough.

I guess I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm asking. I called a therapist today (after a lot of googling to find one I think I would like) and got her voicemail, but didn‚Äôt leave one. I‚Äôm just so scared to tell someone these symptoms I‚Äôve been experiencing because they sound so crazy to me. I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm crazy. And I definitely don‚Äôt want to be sent back to a psych ward.

"I'm not even close to the same person I used to be. I understand that people change and that's normal/healthy but every step along the way I've just been getting worse. I rarely feel happy anymore, the only emotion I really feel is anger or hatred for anyone and anything. Everything annoys me. Earlier today I was talking with my mom and when she started saying things that pissed me off without even thinking I slammed the box of pills I was fiddling with onto the table, sending them everywhere and stormed off. I immediately felt regret for what I did but I can't just take it back. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to people anymore, I very rarely have passion for anything anymore and I don't understand why or how I even became this way. This isn't how people are supposed to live, how do I fix my view on the world? I have absolutely no idea what to do, I just feel like I'm in such a dark place mentally. Relationships of any kind are difficult for me because I just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships. Sorry this is just kind of an outpour of whatever I'm thinking at the time but I'm just genuinely pretty lost as to what I can do to improve my mental state. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this post, I guess just some advice? Anything really. I'm 20/male &amp; unemployed, I don't know how to drive and my mom can't really teach me so I feel pretty stuck in that regard, I also owe ~$400 to my credit card company because of some debts I couldn't pay when I quit my job at a movie theater for another job (that I already had a start date for) and then something went wrong in their systems and I was out of a job, haven't been able to find one since so that's probably part of why I might feel this way, subconsciously? I also gained a lot of weight in the past few months after losing a lot, from 210lb to almost 160 and I'm pretty sure i'm back to where I started, I want to join the Air Force for a few years to help pay for college but first I need to get fit again which is pretty daunting considering all the weight I just put back on and my unhealthy eating habits.

"A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. 

Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned.

I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel.

I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping.

Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression.

I've been seeing a therapist which has been helpful. I've been more thorough about my negative symptoms to my psychiatrist which has allowed me to feel really great about the medicines I'm prescribed.

2017 was better than 2016 for me in every way. I found a new job. I made a ton of new friends. I've taken tons more photos. I've threw several more parties this year with many more guests attending. I traveled three times in 2017, which is a lot for me. I attended way more fun events in 2017 than in 2016. I volunteered more. I ate better. I went to bed much earlier and woke up much earlier. I got many more chores done. I did a lot more reading. I've taken better care of my friends and family. I'm eating much healthier. My body looks way better. I've been going on more dates and more ""successful"" dates. I'm wasting way less money. I clean the place where I'm living way more.

I played computer games and watched TV and read the news (including Reddit) way less. Anything that doesn't feel like it's helping me take good care of myself is a distraction, and distractions were like poison to my depressed self.

But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter?

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. 

However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends!

When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. 

I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do.

Since this is the way it has been for my entire life, I have long ago accepted this and not really worried about it but I knew I was missing out on a lot, especially stuff like house parties, etc...

I don't know if I should post this in /suicidewatch because I'm sitting at work thinking about this and won't go home tonight or in the future to try and commit suicide, but I will move it there if people think it's more appropriate there.

I think about suicide a lot. At least once a day but probably more, and it isn't a fleeting though; I dwell on it.  Recently my favorite band lost its lead singer to suicide and when I found out the method, the first thing that came into my head was ""yeah, this is how I'd do it too.""  Yesterday I was driving down the road and couldn't really shake the idea of ""yeah, I could totally just slam my car into this highway median going 90mph,"" and almost felt a physical tension as my conscious mind restrained my arm from turning the wheel.

That being said, I'm not actively suicidal in that I don't want to die, and while I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was largely considered a malpractice diagnosis and was situational at best.  

I don't mind being alive, and I have fun with the people I love, do the things I'm interested in doing, have an amazing family who loves me, etc.  A lot of the time I feel happy.  I just get really tired sometimes (a lot), everything seems like a hassle to a degree, and in areas of my life professionally especially, I feel like I'm always coasting on mediocre and feel like I'll always be mediocre / kind of lost in what I'm doing (and if someone feels otherwise and that I'm doing really well, it's because somehow I pulled the wool over their eyes).  I can't concentrate on ANYTHING.  It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself, and I travel a lot.

"Hi. I haven't really posted on reddit before, but I really don't know any other place I can anonymously say this. 

I've had depression before, I've beat it. For a short period of about six months, I felt amazing. I didn't care about people who didn't matter, I didn't feel dark and empty inside, it didn't hurt to be alive. But something happened in the summer that has made me feel that way again. My suicidal thoughts have returned, and worse than ever. It was a time when I was the closest to actually killing myself.
I thought it was situational, that it would go away, but it didn't. It just came back and it stayed, and it manifested in a form much stronger than it was in before. 
What's worse, is that I really feel helpless now. I can't tell my family about this, they will only tell me bullshit like ""the power of you will can change this"" or whatever. I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my friends, hence me talking about it here anonymously, and my boyfriend tries to help me but I feel like nothing he is doing is helping, and it's not his fault, it's mine. And I'm afraid that if my brain stays in this stupid place, he will leave me, and my friends would leave me, as people have left me due to that before. I'm afraid I'll be alone again, more alone than I already am. And a lot of the times I feel like none of this is worth it. That I should just go ahead and end this life of pain already.

"This is my first post here, so please be kind.

I am facing the following situation: 10 exams in January (Masters degree level), and a very bleak and uncertain future after that. (No, you don't get a job or internship or whatever even w/ a Masters degree, when you are as much of a loser as I am). Here's the thing though: I have been struggling with depression for a long, long time. It comes and goes in episodes. I noticed that taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin exacerbates my depression. I started taking the pill a year ago, went off it for a couple of months in the autumn, and now I had to start taking it again because my nightmarish hormonal acne started coming back.  My cheeks look like the surface of the moon ffs (just for the record, I'm 25, never had acne as a teenager; it hit me at the age of 22. Now I have both pimples AND wrinkles. yey.) I have tried everything else but Yasmin was the only thing that got me rid of the cysts. I won't stop again. As you can imagine, having a bad, cystical acne AGAIN would make me twice as depressed. With regards to the antidepressants,  I did take Cipralex last autumn but it didn't help really; if anything, it made me feel even more suicidal.

So, future is grim, but I have to push through, sadly. I am giving life one final chance - 2018 will be do or die (literally) -  cos I've taken far too many Ls so far and I am just sick and tired. If I don't get my shit together by December 31st, it's game over. 

Do you have any advice on how to proceed and make it through January? I am looking for some pill or whatever to sort of numb any emotional thoughts/feelings I have and to reduce the frequency of my nervous meltdowns and crying, while at the same time doesn't sap me completely. I need some energy to learn that stupid shit that is required for the exams.

So, I was rummaging through my folders to organise them since they're a mess. I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. 

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.

Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me. I don't want to be a disappointment to my mum, I want to make her proud of me. I don't want my sister and little brother to lose their big brother. I want to look out for them both and be there for them.

It can be so hard to carry on. Everyday I wake up not wanting to be alive, but I don't show it. I don't care about myself anymore. However, maybe things such as this are a reason to at least try.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise.

It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together.

So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay.

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here.

A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups.

Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore.
     I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy.
     I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. 

It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass.

Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life. But I know that it'll probably end the same as all the years I spent at community college did, with nothing of significance happening and not making any friends.",2,"years I spent at community college did, with nothing of significance happening and not making any friends"
"I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. 

I feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.

I posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)

"     You know when that feeling of disappointment when you discover that santa wasn't real and it was just your parents all along? I can't help but feel like that has been my whole life up until now.

     My life seemed just perfect until middle school. I was an optimistic social butterfly with a family that had a decent paycheck. At that time, it seemed like everything was placed perfectly and my life was the envy of others.

      When I made it to middle school, everyone would point out how ""black"" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker than all of them with some really coarse hair). I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1,"middle school, everyone would point out how """"black"""" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker,would tell my mother about how upset it made me,She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant, truly in denial about my skin,my mother cheated on father,she accidentally conceived me"

Basically im a useless, lazy, attention seeking, selfish person who literally deserves nothing even though I get so much shit for free from my parents which just makes me feel bad cos they are wasting so much time and effort into a boring, nothing person. Nearly the whole of the time I am awake is just spent thinking about how I wasted everybody else's time just doing some stupid shit that they could have spent doing something to benefit them but instead they have to sit through my shit which doesn't help anybody at all. I also started cutting my self about a week ago, nobody knows yet and I have no idea why I'm doing it when I think about it I realise I'm just cutting for fucking attention again which just makes me feel like a shitty person. My whole life is paradox, pointless and goes on for ever all I can think about is how much of an attention seeker I am which makes me depressed then I think that I'm just putting on this sadness for attention which makes me think that I'm an attention seeker again and the only way to break thing fucking endless cycle is to fucking die. Every so often I go out to walk my parents dog and because of where we live I have to walk along this busy road with the traffic coming up behind me and every single time I hear a car part of me just hopes one will just smash into me, ending it all. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide on purpose and that will be selfish to everyone I know anyway so I wish there was just a way to just disappear as if I had never even been alive in the first place. Another thing is that I literally have 0 hope for the future, I'm 15 now and going through my GCSEs, but my grades aren't even a problem all my expected grades are above average and fine but every single other thing that is just a complete failure I have no idea how to get a job I have no idea how fucking do anything at home except for sit on my ass and play fucking videogames I have no idea how to be sociable and make friends I have never had a fucking girlfriend and I just realised I contradicted myself with the selfishness and the girlfriend wasting time and now I'm thinking in that same fucking paradox and my life is just turning to shit. Its as if I'm being pushed closer and closer to my inevitable death and it started slow at first but I'm being pushed faster and faster towards it in the past month.

The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. 


The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know

"For the life of me, I can‚Äôt figure out what is keeping me from eating a fistful of pills so I can continue to do the only thing I actually want to do, sleep. I have no one. Even that backup friend I never really liked in the first place, gone. I‚Äôm not sure how it happened. It was like one day everyone turned on me. Each situation and bridge burned is more baffling than the next. I feel like the universe is fucking with me.

For example: Last night my landlord and his wife called me together, bc I didn‚Äôt pay my rent. In California we don‚Äôt have to pay rent until the following day if it falls on a bank holiday. When I tried to politely explain that a bank holiday meant I cOuld not go inside a bank, I received a twenty minute lecture from them both, (because everyone talks to me like I‚Äôm an incompetent female), about how everyone has to pay rent. 
This resulted in my driving around to various stores to get ‚Äúcash back‚Äù following a transaction bc due to daily atm withdrawal limits being$400 and the bank being closed, I had no other way to access the money in my account. So even though I went out of my way to do that series of inconvenient errands, my landlord was still had this to say: 

‚ÄúI have to say this is not how it should be and I will refrain from saying more.
So, it is very late.‚Äù

To which I replied : 

‚ÄúI agree so I‚Äôll refrain as well because this is also incredibly inconvenient for me. That‚Äôs why there is a law for this.‚Äù

From this followed an incredibly uncomfortable in person exchange of cash. Now this where the baffling part comes in. This is what every day of my life had been like for the last six months. It‚Äôs one giant shit on Natasha fest where this dumb incompetent girl can‚Äôt possible be right. ...

As soon as I arrive home from the exchange of cash, I receive a very agitated phone call from my landlord and his wife saying that I did not hand them the correct amount of money. Lucky for me, I had some downtime in the car before the handoff, so I had counted it so many times I remembered that there were 38 twenties 4 tens and one hundred dollar bill. So in the middle of the screaming I try to interject that maybe they could tell me what bills were there so I could see if maybe one dropped in my car. As I‚Äôm asking reportedly for him to count the number of twenties, over the screams of his wife saying not to count it again because they did and it‚Äôs not there, he finally begins to count and shockingly, all the twenties are there. Then shit gets real weird. I start having to argue basic math. I‚Äôm on the phone and I‚Äôm speechless bc as most people with a calculator or third grade math know, 20 X 38 = 760. So I‚Äôm fucked. I am speechless. If they aren‚Äôt going to believe math, something essentially black and white, i might as well start speaking a different language bc nothing I say matters. 

Eventually I could hear the husband starting to realize that maybe the cash did add up correctly so I gave them an out by saying maybe they wanted to call me back in a few minutes. Later I received a text saying, 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all here. Goodnight.‚Äù
No apology. 
And so is my trash heap of a life. Empty. No human relationships. No money. No passion. No desire to get out of bed. And frustrated to tears. 

I hate crying. I spend everyday frustrated to tears.

I wish I was dead.

"so i‚Äôm 16, a junior in high school. my whole life i‚Äôve struggled with confidence in my abilities. i doubt myself a lot and i‚Äôm aware of it, but i can‚Äôt seem to stop doing it. 
but like anyone else my age, i have my permit and i get my license in 6 months.  however, i don‚Äôt like to drive. i haven‚Äôt driven since the week after i got my permit, 6 months ago. i‚Äôm not scared i‚Äôm going to get in an accident or hurt somebody or anything like that. when i did my 6 hours to get my permit i was actually told i was a better driver than most. but i have this issue where i‚Äôm terrified of what others will think of me if i fuck up. something small like doing a shitty job when i change lanes or something scares me into not wanting to drive at all bc i don‚Äôt want anyone to think less of me. i know that‚Äôs stupid and not a reason i shouldn‚Äôt drive but that fear consumes me in my everyday life. 
i promised my dad i‚Äôd start driving after the new year, and i plan to uphold that, maybe it‚Äôs just a hump i have to get over. we‚Äôll see. but with getting my license in 6 months, that also means that i gotta be able to pay for gas money. which means i have to get a job. 
so i‚Äôve tried to get a job before. quit after the first day. i didn‚Äôt like my position, the place itself, or the people. it was a general store that sold sandwiches and drinks and stuff like that. i was the cashier, and being a quiet person that didn‚Äôt work for me. the owner kind of humiliated me by making me repeatedly use the intercom system to call out peoples sandwich orders, saying i‚Äôm ‚Äútoo quiet‚Äù and yeah, correct me once and i‚Äôll fix it, no big deal, but don‚Äôt make me do it over and over, that just put me down. and then my friend who works there told me a few days later how the owners and some of the employees were making fun of me about how i was quiet and that i wasn‚Äôt saying thank you to the customers for their business. like yeah, i‚Äôm sorry i didn‚Äôt do that, that‚Äôs my fault, but it was my first day, i was stressed the fuck out, cut me some slack. the owners also scared me away with their whole ‚Äúyou have to uphold this expectation to the customers because our store has been here for over 75 years‚Äù, and yes i would expect your worker to be nice to customers and have good hospitality but don‚Äôt throw that at me and say that. it just scared me and turned me away. 
long story short, my first job experience kind of was crap and it made me not want to do it anymore. i don‚Äôt want people to criticize me or look at me in a negative way. it just put a bad taste in my mouth. 
so driving and getting a job are my struggles right now, but i have to do them i guess, im just terrified for reasons that i shouldn‚Äôt be worried about. but i don‚Äôt know how to get over my fears.",2,"a junior in high school,my whole life i‚Äôve struggled with confidence in my abilities, i doubt myself a lot and i‚Äôm aware of it, but i can‚Äôt seem to stop doing it"

"It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs some fucking hole in me I can‚Äôt ever permanently fill. I feel like a hollow shell. Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when I‚Äôm alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone I‚Äôm just stuck with myself, and I‚Äôm just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I don‚Äôt actually have any passion or will to live. I‚Äôm just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.

There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think it‚Äôs definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though I‚Äôm a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving I‚Äôve had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one that‚Äôs still going on right now. The first one the girl wasn‚Äôt ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didn‚Äôt go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.

Then I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that I‚Äôm capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. She‚Äôs literally my best friend man, and I‚Äôm hopelessly into her. She‚Äôs the only one I ever open up to, even if it‚Äôs just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesn‚Äôt see me that way. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. Cause that hole‚Äôs there. And while she‚Äôs in my life, it‚Äôs filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, it‚Äôs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl you‚Äôre so into being with someone else, because at least I‚Äôm not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether I‚Äôm actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.

But it‚Äôs just not healthy. It‚Äôs a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that I‚Äôm just fucking broken somehow. I‚Äôm just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like I‚Äôm someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down I‚Äôm still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But it‚Äôs either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy who‚Äôs this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.

People always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I can‚Äôt love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôm just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life I‚Äôm gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole who‚Äôs hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid ‚Äònice guys‚Äô for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I don‚Äôt think it would. I don‚Äôt know how to fix it in all honesty.",4,"pathetic as it sounds, it‚Äôs kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl you‚Äôre so into being with someone else, because at least I‚Äôm not alone"

"~~I apologize if this does not qualify for this subreddit, but I don't know of a better place to talk about this.~~

I never felt like my family truly loved me. They say they do, but all the times that they interact with me feel fake, like they're just pretending to like me for appearances. This is what my gut is telling me, but I don't know if it's reliable.

I wonder if I'm a sociopath. Everyone loves their family, right? So why can't I?

I hate a certain half sister of mine because, growing up, she would always call me names, make fun of me, and just generally treat me like garbage. But anyone I would complain about this to never thought this was anything to complain about. They would be like ""Oh, that's just how sisters are"" and ""Oh, I understand. Me and my siblings fought a lot too, but we still love each other.""

The thing is, I can say with confidence that I DON'T love my sister. At best, I'm indifferent to her. At worst, I want to kill her. But I certainly do not ""love"" her.  I told her this and...it apparently made her cry.

Wait...are you serious? You expected me to love you after the way you've treated me my whole life? Am I crazy to not love being bullied? Am I just weak for not being able to tolerate this so called ""typical sibling banter""??? I need answers, damn it!!

Then there's my father. He's...an asshole. He just is. I really don't feel like getting into how he's an asshole, since I just got through talking about my sister. But anyway...

 Unlike my sister, nobody denies that he's an asshole. However, I am expected to put up with him anyway. Because my father is 71 years old (turning 72 next month), he has been deemed ""a product of his time"" and therefore is allowed to be an asshole because old people are too old to listen and therefore
 I should ""pity him"" because ""he's a lonely old man"". 

But here's the thing: I DO pity him. Of course I do, he's a pathetic human being. But pity =/= tolerate, which is what they're implying when they tell me this. I don't know why they expect me to tolerate this outdated piece of human history when obviously the best option is to throw him in a museum (retirement home) and let him expire. I don't know how I'm an asshole for feeling this way, but I guess I just am.

Those are the main two people that I hate out of this family, but I honestly don't care for any of them. I never felt like I truly belonged in this family. I was always ""the quiet one"" that everyone ignored. I often fantasize about ditching these people and moving to another part of the country, and meet people that I can ""truly connect with"", but of course that'll never happen.  For one, ""truly connecting"" with people would require me to socialize, and I'm as asocial as they come. Two, I'm such an emotionally weak, weak-willed, codependent piece of crap that the very idea of moving away and being all alone is too much for me to bear.  

I'm sure I probably just sound like a whiny spoiled brat to you all.You're probably wondering: If I don't have the guts to ditch them, why don't I just deal with them? Well, they clearly never wanted to deal with me all my life, so why should I?.......................Right?...RIGHT???

I don't know... What am I saying? I don't even know what I want...

Obviously, there's something I don't like about my family, but I don't know what it is, so nothing will ever change...... What if there's actually nothing wrong with them?....What if I'M the problem? What If I'm just a horrible person that will never be satisfied no matter what I do? If I can't be satisfied with what I have, do I just not deserve happiness? I don't know when I became so terrible....Wasn't I always like this? They say no one is born evil, but...look at me....

I'm not sure why I typed all of this out, I doubt anyone will read it...and if you did, sorry for wasting your time...

"I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. 

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Sara‚Äôs house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Sara‚Äôs office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derek‚Äôs and he asks me why I didn‚Äôt ask her for her number I tell him that I didn‚Äôt want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Sara‚Äôs ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesn‚Äôt want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt even try anymore, it always ends the same.",4,"feeling awful, rejected two times in a month"

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut  up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... 
Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you.

"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. 

A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. 

Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. 

I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying?

I just want to feel like someone is there for me. I feel so alone and he's right here next to me. ",4,My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years
"Words cannot describe the emptiness I feel inside. The only emotions I can feel are guilt, self-hatred, anxiety, depression, and regret. I remember when taking a walk on a nice day would be pleasant. Now it's 4¬∞F outside and the sun hurts my eyes. I remember when fresh snow used to look so mesmerizing and fragile. But now I look outside my window, see fresh snow and I think ""Fuck this white bullshit. I can't drive my barely working car in this.""  
Not that I would go and drive anywhere anyway. Nobody wants anything to do with me. People at my school see me as a freak, a social outcast. I wear all black most of the time with bandannas and necklaces. Y'know. The ""Dylan Klebold"" type of kid. Might as well carry a TEC-9.
 Nobody ever approaches me, and if they do it's just bullshit small talk or they are forced to talk to me because of some school group assignment. Also, to put it lightly...I'm not very photogenic. I'm 6'2'' 120lb male. Skin and bones. I'm blindingly pale and have a lazy eye, I can thank my dad's genes for that &gt;:[ And every girl I've ever tried to get has gone after the stereotypical football player hottie with big biceps. I've faced nothing but constant rejection. From everyone. From my friends, family, my teachers, and even myself. Hell, even my fucking *mailman* rejects me. My package has been sitting in your office for three days. I might as well walk the 3.4 miles down to the post office and get it my damn self. What the fuck man?

Anyways....I just wanna disappear to a far away tropical island for a few months with nobody but my crush and a fuck load of drugs. But that'll never happen. I've never been able to have what I want. I had a fucked up childhood, witnessed my mother throw a vacuum cleaner at my father when I was 6 years old scared and shaking in the corner. My half sisters always pestered the hell out of me, which I think is part of the reason I can't talk to girls well. 

I've felt depressed since I was about 14. But every year it slowly eats away at you, and here I am at 18 years old. A legal adult who is a hard drug addict, is essentially broke and works minimum wage, spends any/all income on useless bullshit like the newest adidas shoes or the newest video game, or drugs. Mostly drugs. Ive spent thousands on weed, benzos, blow, acid, shrooms, ecstasy, cigarettes, you name it. I've done it. All besides opiates, meth, crack, and that synthetic weed shit that makes people go ballistic. 
I started young too. Took my first hit of weed at 15, tried ecstasy and LSD at 16, coke at 17, and it all went from there. I haven't been sober in years. I've fried my brain. And I can't stop. I'm heavily addicted to benzos and drinking(more so benzos). It's the only thing that stops the nasty thoughts. The pills are the only thing that make my awful thoughts stop. Every day I think of a way I could potentially kill myself. But I've never acted on it. But I'm afraid I might have the balls to do it one of these days and end this constant suffering. My mind is pitch black. The lights are on, but nobody's home. I'm a ghost. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies are greatly appreciated. But don't ask me to go and seek medical help, I'm already in the process. Sometimes I feel like it's making it worse, considering the USA's healthcare system is fucked.

"Hello. 16F here. I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.

I abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on that dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not

I have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse. 

On December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas. 

I cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive.  On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.

I feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated. Nobody knows the real me because of how different my personality is on Vyvanse, even I don‚Äôt know the ‚Äúreal‚Äù me I've been on this drug so long. When I crash from Vyvanse now, I feel like Im in a dark deep hole. When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines. 

i cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all and I am losing all my friends. I am just so exhausted.

Is this depression? Or just grief?

"The first time shit started to really hit the fan was 9th and 10th grade. My family had just moved and there was always something to bicker about. I was the only child and I didn't do fairly well in school and waking up early when my body for some odd reason decides to default to sleeping like a backwards human being didn't help either. It was the first time I had heard about all of my symptoms being that of someone with ""depression."" Mental illness is not a universally/well-spoken about topic where my parents came from so naturally came the ""How can you be so lazy, how can you get such bad grades when we're trying so hard to put a plate of food in front of you."" 

Things got worse when I dove into self-harm because at the very least it was some kind of relief. My family doctor found out accidentally while giving me a regular health check up. I was interviewed and I could feel my doctor's spite. The anger resonated with my mother and she reacted in anger saying: ""I don't know why she even does that!"" And came the car ride, ""If you hate your life so much why don't you just die."" 

And I almost believed that she meant that and I spent hours crying on the kitchen floor. My mother is the only person I can usually trust, I felt like what was even the point. 

Before we left the doctor's office I was threatened to go see someone and that there would be an issue if they found out I didn't schedule for one. My mom and I both sat in the car and she bargained with me explaining that if I were to go to a therapist, they'd mark my records as a mentally ill person and that I'd never find a job. 

After that I tried my best to cope with it. But then I broke one day. I was having an argument with my mother and it was the first time ever she had physically smacked me across the face. I was mortified and I broke down in my closet. It was the first time I had felt unable to control my own body. It was then my mother decided to give me a listen to the issues I was going through. 

After I calmed down, I explained to her what depression really was and how it feels and what I can and can't do sometimes. She sympathized with me but I didn't think about therapy after that. I told myself I'd eventually go. 

I'm a 3rd year into college now and it's over break. I'm not feeling the best, but better than I have since the past several months. I want to seek help while I can before I fall into another slump.

"I often go to bed at 3-4am and wake up at 12-2pm. I know this is terrible, probably unhealthy, and also when I have to wake up early (for appointments and things) it‚Äôs the worst. 

And it doesn‚Äôt help that when I am trying to sleep, it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm plagued by thoughts about needing a job, not putting enough work into school, what people think of me, that‚Äôs to impossible to be with that girl I like because all I know about her is from twitter, how I‚Äôm a terrible creepy stalker weirdo for crushing on some random person on twitter, you know, the usual stuff.

But when I‚Äôm in bed after 12, and I‚Äôm watching a movie, or playing a game, or whatever, it‚Äôs the only time I can REALLY relax. 

I‚Äôm currently a college student, so this schedule works for the most part. There are lectures and things I have to attend, but those are often later in the day so it works out. 

I live with my big family, (I‚Äôm an introvert, as if that wasn‚Äôt obvious.) and while yes, I‚Äôm able to do things by myself or alone, it still feels... I don‚Äôt know, not as relaxing? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm half relaxing, but the other half isn‚Äôt.

Again my family‚Äôs big, and most of them are loud. I‚Äôm a quiet anti-social shut in, so naturally I spend a lot of time at my desk where my desktop is.... and pretty much everything else. This is setup in the most popular room in the house, so even if I‚Äôm doing something by myself and alone, 95% of the time there‚Äôs *atleast* one other person in the room.

Like I said, they can be loud, playing games, talking to online friends (jealous), and younger kids running around and playing. My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.

It just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. 

**It‚Äôs like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**

My therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away?

"I am 25yr male from India and am living in the US since last year with my parents.

They have always had domestic quarrels and sometimes violence since as far back as I can remember.

This had scarred me for life as I didn't have confidence to talk to any person, I never had a girlfriend nor did I pursue any marriage choices.

I did separate from them for a brief period while I left to train for IT at a different city after my Bachelors.
But then, our immigration case which was pending since more than a decade in backlog was processed and we all migrated to the US.


Here, the tides turned dramatically, at least for my life.

I moved here to study, but I was forced to drop out because my father won't spend any money to care for my ailing mother.

Furthermore, my relatives here abandoned us and even troubled us to the point where they destroyed years of relations and blood lines.

Additionally, I was forced to take job at a crappy place to bear the burden of my Narcissistic Father, my obsessive mother and my innocent young brother.

My Father is more than just frugal but a Miser.
Not caring for his family he buys properties in India while his family suffers here.
He would've killed my mother by not providing her with day to day food and sanitary products had I not abandoned my education and put my hard earned money to provide for her.
He constantly troubles, teases and incites quarrel.
He acts in mischief making my mother shout loud at him and disturb the neighbors.

My mother on the other hand is so obsessive that she sometimes won't even let me sleep alone and would herself sleep on the floor of the room.
She always would be pin pointing at me for trivial stuff.
Would not let me study nor work in solace.

Granted this is an over affection of motherly nature but coupled with my father's mischief is disasterous.

She can argue with him for DAYS (I'm not kidding) on end without even eating a morsel of food.

I can continue for pages but coming to the gist.

My father was doing the same mischief again and my mother called the police on him. Saying that he is abusing(she intended verbal, police assumed physical) the children and her and not letting us live peacefully.

This happened at the end of a shouting session between my parents which all happened in the apartment I leased on my crappy salary from the job I had to take after I had lost all hope in life and no relative or friend would help us.

The police had to write down my name as well as my parents and confirmed that as long as no one physically assaulted anyone they can't do anything.
But if they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away.

Now, I am again scarred to life as I was when I was a kid, a teenager, a young adult and now again.

Country doesn't matter, relations don't matter, dreams and aspirations don't matter to my parents.

They are narcissistic and obsessive fools.

Despite being a University topper and despite being a top notch Computer Programmer, I couldn't fulfill my dream, I couldn't study for my Masters and I couldn't prepare myself and work for a good company.

They have now spoiler my life again and possibly for the last time.

Now I wish they would just leave me alone and be off on their ways.",4,"they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away"

"I'm a twenty year old who still lives with his parents and is going to college. I had been thinking about things recently, namely about how bad my depression has gotten, and I decided I'm tired of feeling this way and I wanted to do something about it. I decided I needed a change, and wanted to finally move out. I went to my family and decided to tell them my plan to move out which they thought I definitely should not do that way I could finish college. While we were having the conversation I began to tear up and my stepmom (who is like a second mother to me) asked me why I was getting emotional about it. I didn't really know why I was but I decided that I couldn't really hide it anymore. I told my parents I was depressed and suicidal and they both began crying. This was a shock to me because I have always felt as if I was more of a drain on them than anything else. It was extra surprising because I had never seen my dad cry, over anything, and I truthfully thought my dad was ashamed to have me as a son. They began telling me how much they loved me, and my dad even told me that he was proud of the man I've become, and I found out that my stepmom struggles with depression as well, and has taken medication for it and says she feels a lot better because of it. We're going to plan a doctors appointment for me and see if medication can do something to help me, because I'm doing a really shitty job of managing it now. I just wanted to post this to really share the experience with you guys, because it has honestly changed my whole world. I had been going through life, day by day, feeling like I was a parasite, feeling unloved, feeling ashamed to be who I am, but now after talking to them I feel a lot better, I feel like I may be able to finally fight this. Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors, I'm writing this in tears, but if you're struggling with depression, and feel alone, and feel like medication isn't for you, maybe you should just open up to someone close to you about your depression.

"I've never opened up before like this before so please forgive the incoming wall of text

My girlfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago. We're still friends, but I can't stop thinking about her and regretting letting it happen. She is what I think about most of the day, and I am on the verge of coming back crying to her asking her to forgive me and give me another chance. She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. 

I started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time. The people I talk to most are still my friends from school and my now ex. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am never happy. I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. 

I am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me.

I try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life. This is meant to be the best time of my life, so why is the best thing in my life the fact that I got a decent amount of karma on a post on my main? How fucking pathetic do I have to be to actually be proud of that?

She‚Äôs probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend.

I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair.

I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.

Last year I had some of the darkest moments in my life. I‚Äôve been reflecting over those moments the last few weeks and I have finally accepted the fact I need help. I‚Äôve always thought I could do things on my own and I didn‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs help. However last year showed me I can win battles on my own but I‚Äôll never win the war without people supporting me. So I decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it. Also I just want to try to be more social in general.  To start out I decided to make a Facebook account since people always seem to ask me that and I always say I don‚Äôt have one. Ironically when I tried signing up it said my name wasn‚Äôt real. Haha can you believe it oh god truly has a sense of humor. Anyway as soon as I got there I started seeing my friends accounts and their friends and even though I knew some these people for some reason I got the feeling I always get when I‚Äôm around a lot of people. The feeling of not belonging. I hate this feeling and it‚Äôs probably because I spent so much time isolates from other people but I never seem to feel like I fit in even with friends. I look at the whole thing and it‚Äôs just not for me. It‚Äôs like these people are happy they have lives they care about others.

"So I'm 23, I've survived two rare cancers that have badly affected my education in high school and university. I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. 

Its gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.
On top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. 

My personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed. I am working on improving my overall physical fitness and am I by no means anti-social but I feel that I can't relate to any of my peers.

No one helped me during my life (outside of my family) and I have no idea what I want to do, I'm not passionate about helping others or any career objectivities or anything at all. I just want to work and be productive so that I can reach a point where I don't have to be. 

I think that I am an intelligent, moral person that can actually bring some value to whatever I do but no one is going to give me chance, because why would they? I don't want to end up on welfare and I want a successful career, I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a purpose. Sure, it's my fault, I could of done better and now just like most of my life, I have to learn the hard way.   

What do I do? Do I go back and study something else to gain a better GPA (and more student debt)? I don't really have many options. Even if I go study something in demand, like engineering or IT, who is going to hire someone in a hands-on profession who can't fully use both hands?

"Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck.

Well, there's no such thing as too much love, but there's always too much unhappiness and bitterness in this world.

"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed. I don't feel obligated to feel sad because I have almost everything good for me. 

I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm.

At least that's the name I've settled on for now.

Currently, my friends are all sharing remorse over one of their girlfriends getting in trouble for being gay (but that's an entire different story that I won't go into) and I haven't said a thing (we share a group chat online). It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

With that in the way, I've just been left alone, left to be the shut-in I am. 

It's already so difficult to carry a conversation with social anxiety.

I only find comfort online or in virtual/fantasy worlds so all I do is play video games.

I used to be so passionate in drawing because it made me happy, but lately it has been months since my last drawing. 

I'm a disappointment to my parents.

I cost so much money.

I do nothing to benefit anyone.

I feel as if I'm some add-on that you can remove, and everything would still function properly.

This may seem all over the place, but I need to vent once again.

I'm sorry.",2,I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm
"Hi, 

I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for.

I love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can. I think I need a bit of a different perspective on this. Is there anyone out there that is willing to share what works for them as ""depressies"" or caregivers.",4,love my wife deeply and would love to help her in any way that I can
"I'm just lying here wondering what the point is of living. I'm not actively suicidal, but I feel like life isn't worth it *at all.*

A brief run down of my life:

I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest. And I'll be in pain the entire time until I can finally just die after a long, disgustingly hard life of struggle. The End.",2,"graduate student.

"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol. Anyone else out there a loner feeling a little lonesome? I'm new to redditt, so I'm hoping I did this right. Take care everyone.",4,"friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them, So I started to socially isolate myself."
"I don‚Äôt remember exactly when it started, but I do remember all those lonely walks home from school. I remember picking up snow and see it melt in my hand and I would tell myself that it was me. I was about 11 I think. 

It all turned worse once I got in my teens. I sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry. Today I believe that was all a cry for help. I did a lot of weird shit, some weird relationships. But I always worked and maintained a job. All the time. I did all my chores and I tried I really did. 

Then you turn 18 and your supposed to start living. I left to work in FL, didn‚Äôt work and moved back to Europe. A lot back and forth and finally decided to be a nurse because of pressure from my parents. At this point I was angry all the time again, but I worked hard to maintain composure and let it all out while I was alone and yes I was alone a lot of the time. 

I met my husband (just got married on Friday) and I thought life would finally make a turn for the better. We decided to move FL after some months in Europe and I was for once excited about life. FL didn‚Äôt really work out because school was not what I thought it was. 

So now we live back in Europe under my parents roof until we find an apartment and yesterday it all came crashing down again. 

I have always been thought to speak my mind if something is not right. I‚Äôm 22 turning 23 this year and I‚Äôm still being treated as a child. My own father stood and watched me cry and told me I never did anything right and that I‚Äôm an embarrassment to the family. I have learned to control my temper, but I am a loud and sarcastic person and maybe sometimes that doesn‚Äôt work. 

It all came crashing down yesterday and I haven‚Äôt felt this bad in years. I told my father I wanted to see a shrink, but he laughed at me and told me to grow a pair. He told me that nothing I do is ever good enough and that I‚Äôm just rude. 

I don‚Äôt know what more to do. I do everything they tell me. I go to school and I work. I smile and try to be funny. I guess the voice was right. I was never good enough and I never will be. ",4,sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry

"Hello r/depression,

Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects. Personally I like the effects of the medicine combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL), but I have progressively felt the need to increase the dose.

Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen?

Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? (I have known that this medicine can increase seizure risk when in high dose.)",3, been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more
"Was once full of potential, playing collegiate ball, doing well in school, had everything I wanted. But a few concussions and stubbornness to get properly treated have led me to a life of constant debilitating migraines, memory issue, and general physical/mental deterioration(depression,anxiety, etc). I went from being a 220 lbs to 170 lbs because I just stopped having the urge to eat due to the constant pain in my head. I‚Äôve seen more doctors than a person needs in a lifetime trying to solve the issues my brain causes, but I‚Äôve reached the point of no real hope. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome and ever since there has been a disconnect with friends and family, a loss of the person I thought I‚Äôd spend my whole life with, and a crushing defeat in regards to continuing my education. I now spend my days tucked away in my dark room avoiding light, loud noises, and social interaction. It‚Äôs not that I choose to isolate myself, it‚Äôs that it literally pains me to do otherwise. I‚Äôve never truly considered self-harm, it would lead to major issues for loved ones I would never want. My friends are already all consistently irritated at how difficult it is to hang out with me, but I don‚Äôt know how that makes me the bad guy (they act as if I am dodging them out of distaste for them or something). Recently I was supposed to go to a big sporting event with a friend in my friend group, but due to the growing frustrations of the others about me, my friend dropped me in order to settle down any issues. After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense. This is mostly just a rant, it‚Äôs hard talking to anybody about all of this because no one seems to ever truly understand. Sometimes I have this burning anger in me about the way my life has changed, but lately I‚Äôve had more of a sense of numbness. Just not caring at all about anything. I wish I could just move far away and restart but that‚Äôs not happening, so I‚Äôm left laying in bed in the dark contemplating what could have been had the last few years gone differently.",5,"After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense"
"I feel bad bc I had to turn away the pest control guy today bc my apt was too messy. The last time the pest control people came apparently they complained to my landlord bc the apt was so messy, and then the landlord sent an email scolding me. It pisses me off bc imo as long as I'm not doing any structural or permanent damage to the property I should be able to live in filth if I want to. But I also know that the way I'm living now isn't healthy. I'm just reluctant to clean bc cleaning up would require admitting to myself that the way I'm living now isn't normal or good for me. 

I also find it difficult to eat. I keep cooking too much pasta, realizing I don't want to eat (even when I'm hungry), and leaving it out to stick to the pan or rot. (Yep, turns out if you leave pasta in the sink for a while green stuff will grow all over it!) I think it's partly bc I like the light-headed feeling of not eating enough and drinking too much coffee. It's basically a cheap and easy way to get high. But lately whenever I ""eat well"" I end up getting intense stomachaches anyway. I had a steak yesterday bc I knew I needed protein but I ended up just getting stomach cramps and diarrhea. 

My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work. She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes. In retrospect I totally understand why she'd get so mad (I *was* being disrespectful) but basically it just made me feel intense shame and that everything I do in the kitchen is basically filthy and gross. Also if I i.e. washed the dishes but didn't put them in the dishwasher she'd get just as mad and I think I unconsciously internalized that unless I completely clean up the kitchen I may as well just let everything sit around and rot. 

My main motivation to clean up would be so I could have friends over without feeling ashamed. (So far I've only let one person who I trust see my apt and I still felt like a gross weirdo.) 

The thing is actually I find dish-washing very calmly sometimes. I've found that concentrating on thinking about the process and how cleaning dishes is satisfying makes me want to clean a lot more than beating myself up about how everything is disgusting.

"Depression and I are at a constant battle. I was home alone for Christmas Eve and it was driving me insane. I felt like ripping my hair off gahhhhhhhhhhhh! To cope with the depression I urge myself to go out. I got put my pants on and went out. I thought to myself what the fuck can be open at 8:30pm that‚Äôs when I passed by Angel City Brewery. It was fucken open. I went inside, it was almost completely empty. I got me an IPA and started walking around, I ended up going to the balcony they have. I sat down on some of the couches they have. I started browsing Reddit like usual, reading every depression post. I was half way done with my beer when some one speaks to me. ‚ÄúIs some one sitting here?‚Äù I asked myself is someone speaking to me!? I looked up and it‚Äôs a girl. I remember stuttering ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù She repeats ‚Äúis someone sitting here‚Äù I say ‚Äúoh no‚Äù she asked if she can join me and I say yes. I‚Äôm looking at her while she‚Äôs looking around her surroundings looking totally confused. She looked like a very antisocial person. I asked her if she was okay. She said that she‚Äôs never been here before and asked why it was so empty. I chuckled and said ‚Äú maybe because it‚Äôs Christmas Eve?‚Äù We both laugh. Soon and then I started feel a warm sensation in my stomach, I began feeling nervous, my depression felt like it was suffocating. 
She asked me ‚Äú do they have margaritas here?‚Äù I giggled. I said no, it‚Äôs a brewery they only have beer. She looked paranoid. I asked if she was okay. She said that she doesn‚Äôt really go out by herself. Then she asked me if I was waiting on someone. I said no, I usually go out alone. I kept looking at her, I asked her what was her name. She told me Maria, I introduce myself. She asked why was I here by myself. I told her I just needed to get out. 
She told me she wanted a drink and asked me if I can go with her to get her drink. I said of course. I started getting even more nervous, asking myself why is this person talking to me. We got to the bar and she ordered a drink, I ordered one for myself since I had finished mine. She grabs her pure and pull cash out and tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúOh no, it on me‚Äù she said thank you. 
She asked if they had any games here, I said of course they have board games. We ended up grabbing Jenga. We went back to the sofa I was sitting at. I‚Äôve never played jenga before so it was my first time. Boy did I fucken suck.  We talked for a while, and told me she moved back to LA from Mexico and to pardon her bad English. I told her what you talking about you speak perfect English. As I got to know her, my depression starting go away, I felt happy, I was smiling. 
It was about to be 10pm when she told me she was feeling tired already since she had a long day. I didn‚Äôt want here to leave, I was enjoying this so much. I told her that it was fine and that I was thankful for sitting with me. I walked her downstairs and we put the jenga game back. We looked at each other for a second. She asked if I wanted her number, I blanked out for a second. Then she said ‚Äú you know what let me have yours‚Äù I gave her my number. She told me it was nice meeting me. And told me I should go home soon because it wouldn‚Äôt be okay to keep drinking. We shook hands and she started walking away. I just looked at here leave the exit, I felt my depression coming back. I walked to the bathroom looked in the mirror when it hit me. FUCK I FORGOT TO GET HER NUMBER!

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt.

1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

I have been dealing with depression for years now and have been doing everything I can to get better. Recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. And even though I have no intention of following through I feel as though my depression would. Whenever I used to get this way I‚Äôd think of all the things I love in this world and I‚Äôd change my mind pretty quick. But now it seems every time I try to do that those thoughts get choked out by my depression. Every positive thought I have gets drowned out and stomped on by the suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. All motivation is gone for me and this point and I do things simply so I am not a burden to people anymore. I‚Äôm scared that in a slump of sel hatred and meaninglessness I‚Äôll do something stupid.. I‚Äôm not myself when I‚Äôm depressed and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.,5,suicidal thoughts and general self loathing
"I've got an obsession with time, so much so I think I'm losing my mind. I don't really know if it's because I'm depressed or not, but just today I quit my job because wasting away for a full 8 hours a day feels like I'm being enslaved by corporate juggernauts.   

Monday through Friday it's Wake up, bathe, dress, eat. Drive an hour in backed up traffic to get to the job responsible for this life sucking routine...Shit, I'm 10 minutes late. Boss is gonna threaten my lively hood for such a simple mistake.    

""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"".  

Yeah that's what my parents say. I can understand the reason but I just don't see it that way. Dress the part, smile and Kiss ass at a job that you hate in hopes for a promotion, 4 years go by and that door still hasn't opened. I hate it. I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon.    

I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me.    

Some stupid motherfucker gets in front of a camera and shows the world how stupid they are for 5 minutes. Now all of a sudden they have millions and have the fucking balls to say that they started a business!? Yeah society loves that shit. Hitting subscribe, follow, retweet, Keep feeding and endorsing it. I went to school, college, got a job and in the end I'm just another nobody with nothing to show for it. That shit gets to me.  

I feel uneasy posting this, not out of fear. I just don't usually share my problems, because hell nobody cares. Don't try and tell me things will get better, I'm past that. I've accepted the fact that most of us are destined to be trapped like rats in a maze for some sort of sick experiment. No matter what route you take there is no exit....except one. I've taken way too long to type this shit. It's 3:30am and I got work at...nevermind I forgot. Guess I'll just go to sleep.

"When I‚Äôm really struggling internally, I overcompensate externally. Think Ross from Friends when he finds out about Rachel and Joey. That episode struck a chord with me because I‚Äôve lost count of the times when I‚Äôve tried to put on a good show and ended up looking like an absolute idiot. I‚Äôd get all loud and animated; try to be funny; try to convince others and myself that there‚Äôs nothing wrong. They say the unhappiest people are the ones that seem the happiest. For a large chunk of my school days, that was me. My face was laughing and smiling but my eyes weren‚Äôt. In my adult life, pretending got harder until I just couldn‚Äôt any more.

Why did I feel like I had to put on that front? Originally it was because I just wasn‚Äôt even acknowledging to myself that I had a problem. These days it‚Äôs more fear of how people would respond if I displayed my true emotions. Some people don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in depression. I don‚Äôt know how, because it‚Äôs everywhere. The word ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù is flung around flippantly by people who are just upset about something or having a bad day. Maybe that‚Äôs where the apathy comes from. People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.

There are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù they expect to get the statutory ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine thanks, how are you?‚Äù Not: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm falling apart and I can‚Äôt cope,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get through the day,‚Äù or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.

‚ÄúWhat have they got to be depressed about?‚Äù

I‚Äôve dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things I‚Äôve heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when there‚Äôs a celebrity involved. Take Robin Williams for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But he‚Äôs rich, he‚Äôs famous, he‚Äôs successful. What‚Äôs he got to be depressed about? We‚Äôll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just ‚Äúgot on with it‚Äù but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything you‚Äôre saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then there‚Äôs the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so sensitive‚Äù

Depression‚Äôs not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we don‚Äôt all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You don‚Äôt have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You don‚Äôt have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You haven‚Äôt got a magic wand. You can‚Äôt fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the workplace, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or anxiety, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyone‚Äôs fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs attention seeking‚Äù

This one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after they‚Äôve plucked up the courage to disclose what they‚Äôre going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase ‚Äúattention-seeking‚Äù used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think I‚Äôve devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who can‚Äôt see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions ‚Äì all of them negative ‚Äì crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me.

"Here's my story,
I have recently turned fourteen and I've recently noticed some really weird changes in my feelings and my behaviors.  I'm not sure where to start so I will try to explain my emotional state recently.
Some pretty weird things have been happeing to me latley and I'm not so sure what to think of them.  I've started having these ""episodes"" where I get super upset for no reason (the no reason is actually another problem I've been having which I will get into in just a second) and I'll just start ignoring people who text me which makes them worried and super upset.  And the ""no reason"" has been a super big problem for me and that problem is when other people treat me indifferently?  Its like when someone talks to me and they'll talk to me in a way that makes them seem like they don't care about me (now I want to adress that this is indeed an incredibly selfish point of view but I don't know how to work on it and make it stop or go away) and it makes me feel like total shit and just start hating everthing.  
I've also noticed that I have barley eaten, which is a pretty normal thing for me because I'm super fucking picky and only eat like snack foods french fries and mcdonalds, but now I'm actually getting scared for myself like today I was basically starving so I went to make waffles at 2 fucking AM.  I'm also aware that not eating is a sign of depression which is kinda scary to me as well because I fell like theres a super high chance that I'm depressed but I do not fucking believe it what so ever. 
I hate trying to talk about how I feel about this stuff to other people because I always feel like its me begging for attention because I'm in eighth grade and I'm used to people talking about their ""depression"" for no reason other than attention.  So I always feel like talking about it is just begging for attention (even though that is a stupid way to look at things because people with real depression do need to communicate and get help) and I always feel bad talking to people about it. 
I really don't know what to do and would like some advice and/or help with this.  I'm also aware that I'm not a very good writer so some of these things lack detail and might just be out of order or not make any sense so if you have any questions fell free to ask so I can try and get you information that you need.

"Hi guys,
Looking for any help I can get!
I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)

I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. 

These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. 
I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember.  I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :(

She said it was an out of mind, out of sight sort of thing and she doesn't really need to tell me every single thing, that she thought I figured it out, but eventually she apologized and said that it was disrespectful of her to suddenly revert to her usual ways when she knows I'm used to the contrary.

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. 

---

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out.

"Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ignoring me and I am not sure why. Now I have been crying just about every hour of every day and out of the past 48 hours I have probably slept through 20 of those hours. I hurt myself again and have been treating the wounds but they were stinging so bad sometimes. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.",4,did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that

"I really don't know where to start, I've never been someone to shy away from sharing my feelings, but for some reason sharing my feelings with people irl right now just doesn't seem to help any more, so I'm hoping for some kind of release or anything by sharing how I feel on this sub.. I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future..

"I just felt like I needed to write about how I currently feel and the stage that I am in my life. I'm a college student, I can be social but sometimes I just don't feel like talking to people or just can't find things to talk about. I also recently realized that no one really checks up on me other than my girlfriend or my family. I'm not saying that I don't value them, it's just that I feel like they feel obligated to talk to me since i'm their S.O. or son. I feel so lonely but I just want to be left alone to do my own thing sometimes. I do so much for my friends. I have this one friend, where since high-school I alone brought him a cake to celebrate his birthday and I buy him gifts and help him out whenever he needs anything. But he doesn't do the same. None of my friends really do the same. I always message them and ask how they are doing but they never ask me how I am. They only message me if they need help fixing their car or doing stuff around the house. I don't mind doing it, but it's got to the point where I think my friends only have me around just in case they need assistance. I did a test where I didn't message anyone for about 2 weeks to see who would check up on me. No one did with the exception of my gf. I Don't know. I feel blessed having supportive parents and a loving girlfriend. But I just can't shake the feeling of feeling so alone without them. They are the only people I actually talk to. other than that im just either sitting down thinking or working on my car. If i didn't have my parents or my gf i don't think I'd really have anyone. It's getting really tiring trying too keep myself busy so i wouldn't have to think about this.

"So the thing here is I stopped caring about my reputation. I care nothing about keeping a good reputation and some of my friends warned me about keeping a 'good' reputation.

"I suffer from some serious intermittent depression. It's never gotten so bad to the point I seriously thought about suicide, but it gets to a point where I am a completely different person. I get angry or sad for little to no reason, I don't talk as much, and I find myself with little to no motivation. 

I've kind of suffered a perfect storm for it though, admittedly. I lost both of my parents before I was old enough to drink, I was made fun of and picked on in middle school, was a pothead loser in high school, and now here I am a 24 year old man with no friends and a girlfriend I'm not exactly satisfied with. 

I get depressed every now and then; one could say that is quite normal and everyone does. But one thing that I don't think is normal is that I've never, ever been truly happy. I know that there are people that wake up in the morning and can't help but smile because their life is awesome and they feel incredibly happy. With most people it's because of a certain thing that they have that keeps their spirits high. Perhaps it's a wonderful significant other that makes them feel like they won the lottery. Perhaps they are blessed with astonishingly good looks or intelligence. With many, it could just be that you have good family and friends to pick you up. 

I have virtually none of these things. I have no reason to be happy. And I never have been. I can't recall in recent memory ever being in an uplifting mood one could deem happy. In fact, I'm aware and those close to me are aware of the fact that I am almost completely emotionally numb. I don't feel happy or sad or mad 90 percent of the time. Terrible things will happen, such as a family member passing away, and I won't feel any remorse. 

I know that this is likely just another one of those intermittent batches of depression, but I can't help but feel that this is the truth. I'm a pathetic, broken man that doesn't really have a reason to wake up happy. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post. Maybe to see if others have felt the same? Does anyone else feel emotionally numb? Does anyone else find looking at others happiness depressing? Does anyone else feel that they've never been happy? Because at times it feels like I'm the only one on Earth that does.

"Hi, I'm 17, male, and I've been having depressed thoughts for about a year now (not sure if that qualifies as having depression). I have friends, but I'm constantly scared that they don't actually like me and when they do i assume they're lying (i have been lied to about that in the past and that makes it hard to trust them). Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). 

I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly. I have no idea what to do with myself so i read or play games to turn my brain off so i don't have to think about anything. 

 I wish i could talk to someone about it all since it makes me feel better but i feel like they'll just be annoyed at me for wasting their time. I constantly have this feeling in my chest of worthlessness that i feel physically, it keeps me awake at night and wears me down. I never used to consider suicide until a few months back, but now these thoughts are getting more and more frequent until I'm thinking them every day. I just want to make this feeling go away and I'll do anything to make it happen. I'm sorry for posting this here but i don't know what to do, i feel so purposeless and i want it to end. I've never spoken about these feelings with anyone. I don't know if there's a specific subreddit for venting so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

"A little background on me. I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old dude. What I meant by ""she makes me feel"" is that before her, all my feelings were very mild, sometimes even nonexistant. Like I didn't really fear anything (except for a weird fear of spiders, but that's besides the point), but I also don't think I've felt love or genuine happiness before. And I was fine with that, I liked being logical and that worked.

But this summer I met a girl. For anonymity purposes, we'll call her L. Now, L is the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. We started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked. Like our sense of humour is pretty much the same and she just feels so easy to talk to. If this isn't the place to post this then please poimt me im the right direction because I'd love some other perspectives on this problem since I'm completely incompetent.

Anyways, I've begun to notice that I feel genuine excitement whenever she texts me and I feel really happy while talking with her. But on the flipside, I feel like she's opened up all the shit feelings as well. I've never struggled with depression before, but I think I have it now. I've cried myself to sleep at 3 am more times than I'd like to admit and whenever I make her unhappy in any way I genuinely feel like killing myself.

So my question is this : Is it worth it? Are the good feelings worth the underlying crippling sadness that feels like it keeps slowly eating away at me? I understand that this might seem like teenage angst but I really don't know this, I've never had to deal with this kind of situation. So any responses and different perspectives are welcome, thank you for reading.

"I really want to connect with people. I really want to be understood, like normal people can understand each other. I really really really really want that.

Why does it have to be this way? No matter what I do I'll always be ""different"" and a ""weirdo"". FUCK THAT.

Fucking, what the fuck am I supposed to do, what am I supposed to do when the only way to connect with someone is to change, but change is impossible? I've felt like this ALL fucking month, but obviously I'm on a comedown right now, I think. Does butalbital have a comedown? I don't know.

Like, why does it have to be shit? I want to feel close to someone, I want someone to hold in my arms. I tried, I worked out, I cared about my appearance, I did everything right. Everything that I could-- and yet, I'm still stuck here just as alone as before. I'm stuck in my room, on a computer.

Is that too much to ask? Is that obsessive? Just to want someone to connect with, and hold? When, your whole life, you've been unable to connect with anyone. Even my own DAMN family, none of them ""get"" me. Why the fuck would a random stranger be able to get through to me? I'm fucking, hopelessly hopeful, that someone is going to come along and expose my soft side, that nobody knows I have.

I have a fucking heart, but I can't share it. There's no way to do that. I'm so depressed, now. It's not just the depression. It's everything. Everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Humans only have each other. But me, I'm not human. So I have nobody. I'm an alien, autistic, spaghetti-spilling retard doomed to never be understood or considered.

I want to just swallow all the rest of my barbs and finish a 6 pack. Fuck it, that's the only way I feel good, anymore. Drugs are the only way I feel good.

I'm too fuckin young for this shit. Why? Why me? I can't do this shit. People tell me ""you have time"". Time can't fix a broken robot.

I don't even know why I'm here. I have Asperger's. Nothing can fix me. Nothing can change me. I'm destined to be alone. I can't help myself, and nobody can help me.

"I think back to when I was a kid and everything was so colourful and vibrant and experiences were new and fresh.

While I'm seeing a professional I would like to find someone who had similar experience maybe?

I have this huge problem where I hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore.
I just find physical pain more bearable.
I used to cut and scratch myself.
Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. 
I know I can't keep on going like this.

My life continued for others, never myself.

Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically.

The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked.

"I feel like shit every single day. Nightmares at night, nightmares in real life. It's just an endless cycle. My family hates me. Nothing matters to them besides accomplishments at school or at work. I'm an embarrasment to them, nothing more. I still don't know why my parents wanted kids in the first place.

This world is so fucked up. Society only wants you to live so they can get money out of you. Everyone is selfish and only thinks about themselves. I try to avoid the news, but every time I catch a glimpse of it, I realise that we're fucking up more and more every day. How can you bring children into this world? How can you expect them to be happy?

I want to die. It's all I can think of. This suffering isn't ending, because I am never good enough and I never will be. My parents tell me to just suck it up and fight against it. To stand up for myself for once. To try to change. But I can't. I'm just weak. They're right, I'm never going to accomplish anything in life. I'm never even going to be able to get a job and keep it. I don't know why they're so against me killing myself, if they call me a burden every single day.

I have to keep living for my grandpa. The only person in this world who I believe is truly good and he loves me to pieces. I can't hurt him, I just can't. But you can bet that as soon as he's not alive anymore, I'll be out. I know it's going to be years and years of suffering ahead of me. I don't know how to push through. But I have to, for him.

Nothing excites me. I don't have hobbies. I either can't do them because of back problems, I'm bad at them and get yelled at by teachers because I don't learn new things or I don't like them. I can't concentrate on books. I hate sports. I can't even watch movies. I'm at a point where I'm just in bed all day, only coming out to eat because otherwise my parents would drag me downstairs.

I have no future. I have no dreams. I have nothing. Only the thought of death brings me some peace.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't expect anyone to help me. No one can help me. I tried therapy but my parents think that's for weak people and I'm not allowed to go a lot. I'm not allowed to see a doctor for meds. I'm not allowed to leave the house without their supervision. What are some random strangers on the internet going to do to change that?

So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting.

"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

"I have no job, and I still haven't finished college. I have no friends, not mention a partner... When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.

Leaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.

So I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony? I am tempted to put in practice the latter.",2,"you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit"

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks

"  All my life, I've been told (I'm sixteen right now) that ""You're in kindergarten, it's going to get harder in elementary school,"" then ""If you think elementary school is bad, just wait for high school."" I'm in high school right now and it's the worst fucking time of my life. Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.

  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.

  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.

  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.

  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. 

  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.

So my question is, does it actually get any better from here?

"This is quite difficult to talk about with people I know, or therapists for that matter, so I'm hoping this platform of strangers will make things easier...

I've had these thoughts for roughly 5-years now, with the exception of a 4-month stretch, when I felt happy (literally for the first and only time). 

The thought of killing myself is not only terrifying, I know that it's wrong (in every sense of the word). I'd never want to put my family through that, nor myself; however, I can't help but fantasize about the idea of some freak accident occurring to put me out of this misery.  

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

"My boyfriend told me he had been diagnosed with depression when he was 15, now he's 30. He takes medication prescribed 5 or more years ago without any medical control. A year ago he had been working with therapist for several months and since than nothing has changed (both in his and mine opinions).

From the one hand, he doesn't want to work, his parents give him money (despite it's hard for them, they both work). He is a journalist, so he can write articles but he doesn't want to. From the other hand, the only thing he cares about is ""social revolution"". He has even moved to another city to be closer to his friends in a radical organization. He participate in demonstrations and so on, but he still cannot wash the dishes after dinner. Anytime I ask him why he does nothing but ""revolution"" he tells me that he has been depressed for 15 years. In the same time he has no depression-related pain, he enjoys food and sex, he sleeps well even without taking his magic pills.

I'm an activist too, but I have two jobs, study languages and do at least something. I had two derpessions in my life, I took medication and I still visit my therapist several times a month. I know what depression is, but if I have depression and realize it than I go to psychiatrist or therapist and do whatever they prescribe. Why doesn't he even visit a doctor, if he tells he's sick?

To my mind, he is trying to get rid of any responsibility in his life, so he has ""depression"". We've been together for 2 years, I love him, everything is ok when I don't ask him about doing something. As soon as I do, ""depression"" comes. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stay with him, but not with his ""depression"". I see my father living in a kind of similar condition, and I don't want to be his sponsor or feel guilt for ""not being empathic enough"", doing whatever he needs, as my mother does.

"Hey guys, this might be pretty long but I have stuff I need to talk about. Oh, and I'm using a throwaway because a family member knows my main account name.

So, I've had depression for as long as I can remember, Originally, I though I was depressed because I was just lonely, so I spent a couple of years on a few dating sites where no one would talk to me because I'm not good looking enough. That made me feel even more worthless than I already did. Until my current girlfriend came along and started a long distance relationship with me. 

When she came into my life, I was in a particularly dark spot where I was having suicidal thoughts constantly and I even got out of bed at one point to grab my scissors and end it all. I eventually decided not to do it and went back to bed. The day after that last part, my girlfriend started talking to me, that was almost 2 years ago now and since she came into my life, I've gotten better and am much happier, generally, than I used to be.

A couple of months or so ago my suicidal thoughts were coming back and I told her about it (she knows everything above this) and then she started freaking out and getting depressed because she felt like she wasn't helping me at all. I reassured her that she was helping me and she didn't need to freak out or get depressed. A couple of days after that, the suicidal thoughts went away for a while.

Lately however, my depression's just really been getting to me and I'm just tired of living. I don't really want any advice, I just want to vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again. Anyway, I'm getting off point here. Sorry about that.

Now, I did say I originally thought I was just depressed because I'm lonely. After being with my girlfriend, we eventually came to the conclusion that it's not really because I'm lonely, I honestly just don't have a reason for it. My life isn't bad, I'm in college and have an amazing girlfriend who wants to spend her life with me. I don't know, maybe I'm just broken or something. I think I should just end this here. I'm not actually going to kill myself or anything, but I am just so tired of being alive. I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate place to post this, but I posted it here because it's something I don't want to tell anyone I know and I don't know where else to talk.

"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something.  However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. 

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled.

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse.


My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy.


Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing.


These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown.

"Forgive me if my English has some errors. I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to try to explain this as clear as I can.

I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion in her mother's province. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now.

"Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.

I've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of ""talk to people"", ""you don't need friends in college"", ""girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future"").

Since being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life. So, with all that said, does anyone know if Zoloft is likely to cause this misery again? Or really does anyone just have any advice for me? I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.

TL:DR - Was prescribed Paxil for 5 months, turned me into a monster and made me feel absolutely terrible. Now have a 25mg Zoloft perscription and am terrified of what's gonna happen when I take it.

I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death.

I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time.  About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better.  It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me.

Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling).

The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again.  I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

This feels like a really hopeless situation for me currently, but I wanted to write this to see if anybody has had something similar happened to them before, and how to dealt with it?",5,eally self-loathing and just worse

"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).

"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear.

So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes.

The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but...

This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks.

I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions?

"I know people say not being interested in previous hobbies is a textbook symptom of depression, but it kind of contradicts other things that I hear.

I'm 19 now and since around 15-16 I guess I slowly started to get more towards the state that I'm at now. I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.

I've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense.

I feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy.

It annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? 

Like I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.

Doctors have been telling patients they are sick, while ignoring the obvious bad health effects of eating too much gluten or sugar. Your gut microbiome and brain chemistry and diet are intricately related, and the modern diet of toaster waffles, fried chicken, and bread/cake may be a major cause of many health issues. And a healthy diet has no bad side effects, unlike some medicines.

"And to make it worse, they're younger than me. Basically I discovered a streamer on twitch who is exactly the kind of person I wish I was. I hate myself/my ""good"" qualities. I care too much what others think, by instinct I think about others and put their feelings first. I hate it and don't want to be like this. 

I want to be a popular twitch streamer and be good at video games. Who I am is pretty much the opposite of the kind of person you have to be to be that. You have to not care what others think to be a streamer, for when people inevitably say mean things about you. 

Basically I just found someone who is everything I want to be and everything I'm not, and I feel crushed. I don't even feel like a man, like if you laid out my attributes personality and emotionally-wise, I'd mostly match that of a woman's instead of a man's.

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, like she never stopped messaging me and sent me pictures and videos of herself randomly. She made me feel really important. But I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting this much she obviously meant a lot to me, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

"I'm 2 years away from graduating from medical school. Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health. I'm not the same person I was when I started and I don't know if its because of a past toxic relationship, school or something else. I originally went into it because I wanted to help people (bit of a cliche, I know) and I was interested in the human body. 

But now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. 

Increasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. 

The only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). 

More than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. 

But again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. 

Not knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. 

There are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally.

I hate being Indian. I don't hate Indians. I love our history, our culture, our languages, our people... but I hate BEING Indian. I hate having to explain to annoying ""progressives"" that think that India is an extremely misogynistic country or the like.

Even if it is, I don't see what I have to do with it? Why can't I be associated with the thousands of Indian men that marched for the rapists to receive justice? Nope. Guess I can march for my country's women, get hosed by the police, but I'm still an evil Indian rapist. Great.

Now that's not something I've gotten more than twice IRL, and dozens of times online but I hardly care about the latter, but I still wanted to mention it.

Now the weird thing is that I don't even know if I have a sexuality. I sometimes imagine myself as asexual.

This is because:

1. I find breasts and women in general to be attractive

2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)

I wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?

It's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.

I don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.

For a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.

Is physical appearance just the elephant in the room?

Whenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is ""you're not even ugly.""

What about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?

What do I do then?

""Ugly"" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?

I'm fuming.

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. 
I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. 

About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. 

I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me :

""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone. ""

Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent. That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality. I don't want to feel even stupider.

- Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic.
- Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost.

"Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for? My depression has gotten really bad again in the past 2 years and I've spent alot of that time in my room or depressed outside in a zoned out state of mind. One of my best buddies which was my Lovebird absolutely loved being around me. They are silly little birds and do really odd things and love to snuggle with you.

But with my depression I used alot of that time being by myself without my bird. Of course like most things you don't realize how incredibly important they are to you till it's too late. When I woke up to find Kiwi dead in her food bowl I was just devastated. It really didn't hit me bad till a few days later when I realized how she could of helped me during my depression and how my depression caused her to live a lonelier life as well. I knew it was my fault 100% why she died and looked into alot of things that I thought were safe for birds that did harm to her. 

I even did a proper funeral box for her, wrapped her in an orange towel, flowers, golden sacred art with quartz crystals and buried her in my backyard. 
It even got the people in the parrot sub to shed some tears. 

Time hasn't helped and I truly feel like a part of me, one of the few remaining pieces of happiness has been torn away from me. No matter what she always wanted to hang out with me and we've been through alot the 10 years I had her. I still remember coming back from the hospital after my suicide attempt where I was gone for a few weeks and when I came home she freaked out when she saw it was me, chirping and flying around the cage like she couldn't believe I was back. I used to meditate with her outside, play all types of games and now its all over.

Sometimes you get that one pet where it's just a really incredible bond and it sucks when something shitty like depression ruins the time I'll never get back with her along with the stress or loneliness I caused her.

If any of you have pets you love, really try to be with them more often to see if they will at least rid your mind of depression or at least have the comfort in knowing that your making them happen. It may not solve your problems but this whole situation has shown me how delicate life is.

"Before I start, I just wanna say that I am in no danger of harming myself, I'm simply just going through a rough patch in life. 

I'm in the middle of winter break of my senior year of college and have never felt more lonely. Despite having a strong friend group at college and being in an amazing relationship with someone I love very much, I feel totally isolated. Many of my friends from college and my girlfriend live in the same town, while I live 3 states and 10 hours away from them. At home, I have found that, since starting college, all of my friends from high school have practically abandoned me. Despite seeing them frequently hanging out over the past 4 years on social media, I have yet to receive a response to any of the texts I've sent out, and, as a result, I find myself at home with no social life, thus causing a strong re-emergence of my depression that has pretty much taken over my thoughts. I live in a pretty rural area, so there aren't many ways to meet new people over break due to how spread out everything is and the extremely cold weather. While I've been able to spend some time with my family, my parents have to work most days. 

While my friends and girlfriend have been hanging out frequently, I've been delegated to sitting at home alone browsing through netflix. To make matters more difficult for me, I've been pretty open with my girlfriend about my situation but have found that she has been rather unresponsive due to a very active social life and busy family schedule at home. Its important to also understand that she has serious depression as well and recently moved to the town she's currently in 2 years ago and had some trouble meeting people as well, something with she has obviously overcome.  There have been one or two days where we've been able to text back and forth for a few hours, where I've been able to share my feelings with her about my break and have received helpful advice and comforting words in response; however a majority of our days have been delegated to a ""good morning"" text, one or two 5 minute check-ins throughout the day and a ""good night"". For example, on New Years Eve I was stuck at home alone (parents go to bed early) and asked my girlfriend earlier in the day if she'd like to talk for 5 minutes at midnight. Upon the drop of the ball, I simply receive a ""Happy New Years, I love you"" text, which I reply to asking if she wants to talk and then receive no response for the rest of the night until I said I'm going to bed to which she immediately responds good night. Due to my loneliness, I've tried to arrange some skype sessions or phone calls with her, because it'd be nice to have someone to actually talk to thats not my family, but have had little success. I find that some days I'll ask her if she'd like to have a phone call to which i recieve a ""maybe"" response, only to later find out that she made plans after our conversation to do something with her friends. I've been having trouble finding a way to communicate to her that it would be nice if I were to be able to skype of talk with her at least a few times over break while also trying to give her space to enjoy her time at home. I understand that she's been really busy, it just feels like she's made no efforts to try and talk with me. 

This situation has left me extremely conflicted about my life and my relationships. I know I tend to overthink things a lot when my depression re-emerges but I also find it frustrating that the person with whom I am closest doesn't seem to have a desire to talk to me. I'm hesitant to text some of my friends individually because I've never really had serious depression problems while I've known them and don't know how they'd handle it. I don't know how to cope with this situation I'm in. With graduation and adult life looming for me as well, I find myself anxious, lonely, depressed, and overthinking my entire life. The only friends I have I've made while in college and I will soon moving on from that stage of my life. I know that I'll still be friends with them in the future, but will likely be spread out across the country. I'm nervous that I will continue to have social troubles outside of college in the real world and find myself constantly googling how to make new friends in new places. Loneliness is one of my biggest fears in life and even facing it short term has unleashed a world of problems within me. 

I hope that this ""rant"" isn't too scatterbrained or jumbled, I just wanted to get it off my chest.

It's been a real hell for me since 2 years when my mother died and I am forced to live and get tortured by my stepfather but since December, I feel like I've been going through much worse things now. 

I'm already suffering enough from horrible family abuse, death of my mother, finding out the hard and sad truth who were my real parents, social anxiety and losing nearly all of my friends, but I've been now also suffering quite alot at college.

I'm getting nearly constantly bullied by my groupmates since the first week of college. I've been called names, humiliated infront of others, including teachers, even physically hit couple of times. I've tried to ignore them and report them to our teacher, but that did do nothing, only if anything, my teacher also made fun of me and believed their rumour about me infront of the group. Other groupmates won't do anything about it either because they all know each other. Some of the bullies are even bullying me together so I can't do so much about it, they also keep bullying teachers too and have the worst grades ever.

I almost literally have no friends in college, except few guys and they betrayed me too. It's so hard for me to have great grades when you're basically alone all the time without any help at all.

In the last day when we were on practice, they refused to work with me and they shamed me the whole day, I didn't get to do anything at practice at all because of them, that made me so hopeless in myself and I don't feel motivated to improve practing after this at all. 

It's really hard for me to live with my stepfather who often emotineally abuses me alot and tried to kick me out of home once, with a family that tried to commit me into mental hospital in a sick way, without friends and being constantly bullied in college. I feel like giving up anytime soon and accept my fate if nothing changes.

The only game that makes me feel better for awhile is Life is Strange. It has alot of situations which hit me home and I would relate to them so hard, making me feel better feeling that I'm not alone. Also the game mainly is about friendship, Max, Chloe and Rachel are really great friends and I've had these kind of friends before I lost them unfortunately. Actually felt I wasn't alone while playing this masterpiece game.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again.

"I'm really depressed. There's no one here to help me or to force me to get up. I've been in bed for a few days, only getting up to go to the toilet and refill my water. I haven't had any energy to make food so I've not eaten in 4 days. Just water. 

This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.

The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.

None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.

How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.",5,"How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself"

"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- I‚Äôm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also I‚Äôm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message.

"I got out of the army last year three months before I turned twenty eight and moved back into my mom and stepdads place because my credit was still ruined and I was still in debt from eight years earlier... because of my mom and stepdad. It's a long story and I won't go into detail but they stole money from me when I was twenty and it forced me into what seems to have been a perpetual road of nonstop failure and deep, deep, *deep* self loathing.

I injured myself in the army and got a nice chunk of permanent disability, making me set for the rest of my life. This is nice and all, but this wasn't my goal. I wanted to do my job in the army but no one ever elevated me. I wasn't hated either. That's the part I don't get. It seemed like everyone liked me but no one ever put even one extra second of effort to elevate me further. I watched everyone else get ahead as my physical state deteriorated and after four years, realizing I was going nowhere and was never going to get the qualifications to do my job on the inside or outside, opted for the medboard option.

When I got out I moved back home with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and blood brother in a five bedroom prefab home because my credit still wasn't fixed, and what I saw enraged me. 

My mother had put on two hundred pounds, already weighing a sturdy four hundred. She'd sat in the same spot watching TV for the entire time I was in the army. My mom no longer abused me emotionally or physically but now she was doing this to my autistic stepbrother. She berated him daily. Even worse is that my stepdad was too wimpy to stop it and forked my mom over thousands upon thousands of dollars so she could buy fake little business licenses and crap off Amazon for the sole purpose of making sure no one else got my stepdads money... except for my brother.

I love my brother. He is my most prized person and we grew up together, but my mom has simply paid for him to sit on his ass and smoke weed, turning his mediocre hobby into a job with a whopping thirty thousand dollar ""loan"". I've never been treated this way. Since I was fourteen it was ""get a job"" while my brother was allowed to sit around and smoke weed while I busted my ass during all the best years of my life.

We lived out on eighty six acres and my mom wanted the land clear cut for some sort of farming operation, one of her hair brained schemes. It takes lots of time, money and machinery to clear cut eight six acres. She expected me to do it for free, by hand and with an axe. I said no.

At some point I began buying my own tools and storing them in the shed and would use them on and off again. Slowly I noticed they'd simply disappear. One day, when my mom thought I was gone, I watched her waddle into the shed, take a handful of my tools, walk them into the woods and toss them somewhere I could never find them. She'd toss my axes into the truck with the trash pile and take them to the dumpster. Nothing had changed. She was still hell bent on destroying my property and due to my credit I couldn't even get my own place. After three or four months of drinking, I broke and went to rehab.

I wound up moving in with my girlfriend. I won't badmouth her but we drifted apart during the army and she never got me on the lease, instead inviting a random girl to live with us who couldn't pay rent. Because I had no say, and things had fallen apart between us, it ended after a month and a half.

I moved back to a friend's uncle's place and for three months I got my finances in order. During this time I met up with a girl I'd known since middle school and had always had a crush on. Things went great. Our first date was awesome but she made it clear she was celibate and wanted to get married before having sex. It was annoying but like I said, I'd known her since middle school.

We dated for three months. Not like we were going out as girlfriend and boyfriend but going places and having deep discussions about our future lives together. Ya know, all that sappy relationship stuff.

We finally went on our final date and she invited her friend. The date was awesome... until her friend got drunk. We went camping for three days and on day three I assume her friend saw the attention she was paying to me and cut a nice wedge between us and berated me for hours. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle but sometime around midnight I fucking exploded after she made up another story and called me out for something that I wasn't even lying about. That night I asked the girl I was dating if this was worth pursuing and she crawled out of our tent and into her friends. She later claimed she was drunk and thought I made a move on her but it was worse than that, she'd had a boyfriend the entire time and was intentionally friend zoning me and hadnt expected me to find out if this was worth my time. 

It gets worse than that though, there was absolutely nothing between us, at least on her end. She hadn't been attracted to me one single bit. Even worse is that during our falling out discussion, she wouldn't even admit she had a boyfriend, I had to find out later through friends and hearsay. The last time I spoke to her she just cut me off for admitting how I felt and being upset but she never blocked or deleted me from Facebook. She just saw my messages for a month and would occasionally reply with a snippy one word answer until I blew up and forced her to block me. THIS finally seems to have broken me. A month or two earlier she talked me into getting an apartment on a year lease so we could have somewhere to hang out when she was in my neck of the woods, so now I'm fucking stuck with an apartment until August, in a part of town I moved to because I could find a free place to stay until I was able to get back on my feet, where I only know a small handful of people.

I am using my GI bill to go back to college and maybe I'll find some purpose and a woman to live my life with, but everyone my age is married with two kids and a house. I missed out on the entirety of my twenties, and blew it with a girl I'd known since the sixth grade and felt totally fucking berated. I haven't bothered to find anyone or make friends or even to make eye contact with anyone lately and have relapsed multiple times.

I just want to take my meager army money and buy land and be a fucking hermit and live the rest of my life wondering about what could have been if I'd been raised better by loving and hard working parents, or had opportunity, or had someone say ""you're next in line for success and great things"", but none of that happened. I don't think it's because I'm hated, because people genuinely seem to like me, but that's it. I'm just that guy with the pearly smile who's fun to talk to but nothing more. 

On a final note, I will say this. I got out of the army and I remembered how social I was *before* I joined, but once I got out I saw how everyone had moved on or had burned out. I'm in purgatory. Im somewhere between success and failure. I'll never hit rock bottom because my body gave out under the strain of army life, but I'll never make more than I work for in an entrepreneurial manner. I've thought about opening a bar or something like that but I've been denied a home loan and VA business loan so many times that it's now affecting my credit despite only having one tiny and insignificant debt left.

It doesn't matter I guess. I'm boring, I'm bored and I don't know what to do and the world has moved on from when I was young.

I‚Äôm almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. I‚Äôm actually doing okay though. That‚Äôs not my worst problem.

I have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet I‚Äôm not happy.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm sad, I just feel numb to things. I don‚Äôt get a feeling like my brain‚Äôs active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. 

My health is bad. I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since I‚Äôve been a teen it‚Äôs been really out of control. It‚Äôs fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. 

Because of my diabetes I can‚Äôt do the only thing I‚Äôve ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. It‚Äôs entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.

I feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didn‚Äôt feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and ‚Äúexciting‚Äù.

I hate school. It‚Äôs where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality it‚Äôs a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and it‚Äôs like a holocaust for young mental health. I‚Äôm smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just don‚Äôt do anything even though I‚Äôm in the upper level classes.

And even if I did great in school, what‚Äôs it for? I don‚Äôt feel interested in doing much else. 

I would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what I‚Äôm living for sometimes; even though other times I can‚Äôt fathom how I‚Äôd feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.

I don‚Äôt like myself. My hair is really bad and I can‚Äôt fix it really, I think I‚Äôm gonna go bald, I just don‚Äôt like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation. I don‚Äôt know if my personality is who I want it to be.

Problem is as soon as I sat down I started to cry uncontrollably, I was overwellmed by negative thoughts and feeling.

Problem is now I can't shake these feeling I stay up late at night thinking about it, i go to places to be alone like the beach just to cry(Yes I know pathetic). I'm on dateing sites and go out to bars/clubs with mates, but I just can't seem to find a girl.

"Hi guys, I might need some help.

I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge.
I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them.
I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). 
I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say.
So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while.

The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

**Here are some ‚Äúpros‚Äù  about my therapist:** 


- Specializes in my issues

- Good listener

- Empathetic 

- Takes my insurance so it‚Äôs pretty affordable 

- I am comfortable being vulnerable around her and telling her everything


**Here are some things I find questionable. Please help me decide if this is normal:**


- Only took notes during the first session (I‚Äôm not sure if she takes notes after the session or not)

- No homework or things to work on. When I asked if there was something more I could do about a certain thought pattern, she said I was already doing it just by going to therapy. End of story. 

- No direction or check-ins. I do 99% of the talking. She never directs the conversation or checks-in about stuff we have talked about. She waits for me to initiate all talk. If I spent the entire session talking about some silly tv show I saw, she wouldn‚Äôt direct it back towards anything. 

- Her responses to almost everything are ‚Äúhow do you feel as you are saying that?‚Äù Or ‚Äúthere are a lot of layers to your pain.‚Äù 

- Not sure that I‚Äôm making progress towards anything. It all just feels like I‚Äôm unburdening to a third-party. I don't feel better after my sessions and I don't feel like I've gotten any better. 

- I have twice asked her if I should be on antidepressants. Both times, she seemed reluctant to even talk about it. We left off both times with me being no more clear about whether or not I should pursue this, how to go about getting a prescription (can she do it? Do I go to my family doctor? Either way, she never gave me my options or how to move forward)


If this is normal to therapy, I‚Äôm happy to continue going. What I would like to avoid is getting trapped with someone who may hold me back from actually making concrete progressions towards being healthy and whole.

 I don't want medication to be a crutch. I want it to be a stepping stone up. I know I can be okay.

But the more I read, the more shit-scared I get. Seems like there's almost nothing but negative experiences online. Side effects, people literally becoming dumber/having cognitive impairment, people losing sexual function for months, years, sometimes forever, SSRIs being glorified placebos with side effects, heroin-like withdrawals, people tapering off and having their depression/anxiety later come back doubled, etc. It all just seems like some impossible insidious trap. The more I read the more I almost cannot believe these are prescribed.

 I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here. I've read some best-case scenarios of people going on medication, switching across a few until they found one without side effects, staying on it for only a few months or years until things were better, then slowly stepping off them and continuing to be okay, using the techniques and habits they built while on medication. Maybe all the bad things I've read are because people experiencing negative effects are more likely to be on reddit telling others about it. But there's just a sea of negative experiences, side effects and anecdotes out there which are impossible to ignore.

"I'm sorry if this post ends up being long, I'll try to keep it short but please read to the end if you can. Basic background information: 20 almost 21-year-old male, I'm currently studying computer science (in my 3rd year in college). I actually took the 2017 fall semester off because of how uncertain I felt about actually studying computer science and I just felt terrible in general due to anxiety/depression. During my time off I worked to save up some money and sought help for my issues. Been going to therapy and got meds for anxiety but nothing for depression. Everything was going relatively well/getting better until I had to go back to school. My thoughts of self-doubt began to creep back in and everything just feels joyless. This always seems to happen when I feel stressed about change or literally anything else. I've lost a lot of interest in things I usually enjoy and just feel down. I feel like a failure because I'm thinking about changing my major with a year left. It'll most certainly add an extra year to my college career (I understand that this is actually somewhat common but it still makes me feel bad). To make it even worse, while I'm feeling uncertain of what to study, I genuinely have no idea what I'd study instead cause I'm so damn indecisive. I don't know where else to turn. Computer science seems cool to me but the work seems so joyless because most positions are desk jobs from what I can tell which makes me feel depressed knowing that's what's waiting for me when I graduate.

"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore. During the summer I quit taking my medications and going to therapy because I thought it was a waste of time and that it was just a way for people to control who I am. Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. 
The meds hadn‚Äôt been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day. This made me want to be sicker so that I could feel more special or like I had more inside me to be expressed. 
I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses.

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

Currently taking klonopin 1mg 2x a day only. Psychiatrist thinks some people are not fit for antipsychotics as I always get all the side effects (Same with antidepressants)

Heavily recommended the deeply researched book ""Shock"" by Kitty Dukakis and research by CORE if you want to look into medical journals",3,"eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin , a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking, from a crazy psych cocktail, got B.

"I wrote something poemy that basically describes my state  
I've been depressed for over 5 yrs and have trouble sleeping,very vivid dreams lately that just packs extra punch when you suffer in dreams as well in real life...  
NOTE: i wrote it very early in morining (4am) and i wrote like 2-3 poems in my whole life and i suck pretty badly at it

Fear comes, believe my eyes, i cannot!  
My body starts shaking in terror, as the creature fades my despair sets.  
As fear comes cold and bare, i can't seem to shake the despair.  
My own mind cursed i did, but help, it did not give.  
To ease my despair sleep, i shall i said to myself.  
  
&gt;As i fell asleep another trouble came quick.  
I enter a world, dream yet not a dream, i am wake but sleeping, resting but weeping.  
A world filled with despair as my own yet different.  
World as vivid as life itself, i curse myself in a dream as in life.  
I curse myself, i suffer as i did, in a world as vivid.  
  
&gt;I wake up can't think, dream yet pain, memories not forgotten, no! i remember it all, the pain continues as i try getting up, but move i cannot!  
There i lay thinking ahead, why i move cannot? suffering in a bed.  
It stroke me as lighting in a tree, it's not my bed, im still not free!  
Opening my eyes i woke up in dread, all soaked up, really this time, the terror stroke me as i remember the dreams, the suffering, as real and vivid it can be!  
Reliving it again, like the first time, suffering, giving in.

"after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago).

my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual.

don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though.

My name is Daniel, I am almost 18, ukrainian student in Poland. Recently I've found out that I'd done nothing, and hadn't learned anything compared to my friends, and the reason of It is my laziness.
I've tried a lot of different activities, but was to lazy to deal more time for them. As a result - I have problems with extra weight, so I also blame myself for it, because girls think I am ugly...
Because of it I'm now in a deep depression for like a year and a half now and I don't know what to do. I can't find any new friends, because I'm scared of people and what they would think about me...

I have that annoying feeling of lonliness and ""uslessness"" I can't fight. I'm just usless piece of meat that don't have any motivation, I know that I am a dissapointment for my parents, and I am really lonely.

"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell.  She and my father are separated.  He's struggling with his own battle.
I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away.  I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). 

She's lost her white collar job about a year ago.  She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go.  Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape).  I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse.  I can't quit college to move back and take care of her.  Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her.  

Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier.  She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement.  She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this.  She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job.

She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite).   I don't know what to do.  I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.  ",4,She and my father are separated.  He's struggling with his own battle
Went out to a bar on New Years and ended up dancing singing and making out with this super cute random girl all night. We were popping bottles of champagne drinking straight from the bottle it was so much fun and the only intimacy I've had with a girl in probably over a year (I'm 22). I never even got her name or number but I'm so fucking lonely that I can't stop thinking about her. It's pathetic. She prob hasn't thought about it since yet I can't get it off my mind. I keep looking at Snapchat vids we took together too because it's the only fun I've had in years and I don't want it to end. Idk I feel like a fucking loser ,4,"can't stop thinking about her, It's pathetic"
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"I'm so exhausted. I'm tired of being broken. I wallow in self pity everytime and wonder if anybody cares. I know my loved ones do but should they keep shouldering on my burdens. Crying and burrowing under the blankets to shield myself away from people, from my anxieties, from my unwarranted sadness. I'm over telling everyone and myself that I'm fine. This feeling of depression weaving in and out of my life is slowly destroying me. After writing this, I would be fine and back to enforcing optimism...and then slowly depression crawls back again.

"Alright, So I'm fucked out of my mind. In less than 2 hrs i drank 6 beers and a half bottle of free wine I got. I think I'm at rock bottom. I don't know where to start. I'm in my late 20's. Never had a GF, never thought I deserved one. I make every friend Ive ever made just feel sorry for me and then i push them out of my life. I'm so fucking alone. But that's because i want to be. But I fucking dont. I want to be somebody and happy. But my brain keeps telling I dont. I go out with my only friend maybe once a month. She ain't really a friend, she just pities me. Or I guess maybe she is my friend because she pities me and cares enough to try. idk, I cant figure it out. Even though I want to be personable and fucking fun to be around, I constantly just fuck it up. Then I just think about it for the rest of the month and keep playing in my mind how to redeem myself. Then i fuck it up again.

 Ive never been to a doctor. what do i do? just say my head is fucked up give me something to make me feel normal? i have shit health insurance. i hate my job i dont want to work extra just to pay for meds and therapy. why am i on this sub. i  sound like a 4 yr old haha mods just delte this. but seriously see what i mean about wanting pity? but also feeling feeling bad about wanting pity? Stop drinking? you nuts?

"It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. 


With that being all said I developed this ""someone"" with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. 


When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me.

"22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak. I only answer either ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù on those days. I could have a few normal days in a row only to have them followed by a week of being afraid of everything. My eyes have been also more sensitive to light lately, if that means anything. 

In the background of all this is a strange sensation that I‚Äôve been told by several people is only a symptom of depression. I have no emotions or interests. I don‚Äôt want to talk or see anyone. Nothing in the world around me seems real, I don‚Äôt recognize myself or my thoughts, and I feel as though I‚Äôm watching myself go through the motions of life.

"HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.

 This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. 

One of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and ‚Äùupgraded‚Äù the interior of the house. 

Years and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.

I was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.

My stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.

Here, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.

Since she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.

But I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.

She was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.

Since my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.

Whatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.

My sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. 

We've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.

After I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.

I'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.

I drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. 

A long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.

I need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit but I need some outside opinions. 

Some backstory:
I'm currently attending college.
I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. 



One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend.


At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. 


Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc.



For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring. 


Does anyone know what I might be experiencing and how to fix it?

"I was recently diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, OCD, and depression. I met with a on-campus counselor and after several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist, and after several meetings with him and with other professionals I was finally diagnosed (took almost a year).

The fucking issue is I can't get help at all, all of the psychiatry work was done at a near by mental hospital. And the counseling was done on campus, I was referred to several therapists/psychologists/specialists/etc to continue work but I don't have a car and counseling on campus is very limited in the amount of sessions you can do (10 per 2 semesters/or per issue).

So I'm fucked because I can't afford any of my medications because I'm a poor American and thus don't have healthcare and can't afford medication, I don't have a car and there a no therapists near by me that I can walk to or ride the bus too.

"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression.  Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.  I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling.

I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy.  She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it.  I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasn‚Äôt effected my work, in a weird way it‚Äôs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive).

"I've created a throwaway-account because the one person that knows my reddit account is my brother and I don't want him to find out about my mental state. First of all, sorry for my grammar being off, I'm trying my best but cirumstances (being a drunk german) make it kinda hard.

So I'm sitting here at 5 AM, drinking whisky and feeling like I've hit an all time low. I honestly don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish by writing this, perhaps.. I don't know.. I want to tell people how miserable I am but I don't want them to pity me.

I've began studying informatics at my local university, it's my first year. I've decided to move out of my parent's house, which I'm kind of proud of. However, I'm unmotivated as fuck. I basically don't go to lectures, I literally spend days in my bed (I'm not kidding, sometimes I just don't eat because.. I don't why honestly, I just dont feel like getting up). I don't really socialize, I just imagine how fun it could be. I wish I had the balls to do it. I wish I just could go out there and show them, that I'm not that fucked up. But I am. I really am.

I could write about my problems for ever, because there are a lot more. But I feel like no one cares anyway, I mean why would you care about it. I hate myself for writing this. I hate myself for everything I stand for. And I don't know how to fix myself

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, if it doesn't: downvote and move on. As I said, I don't know why I wrote this, I never told anyone about it, felt like I needed to get it of my chest.

"I finally went out to do something with my few friends. I've had a crush on one of them for at least 3 years and one of my other friends that knew was also asking a girl out there and said I should ask the one I liked as well. 

I was really scared because I've never had a girlfriend and the one time I asked someone I was rejected and I'm terrible at speaking to people and I just freeze up when I get nervous which was definitely happening now. I tried to talk to her and of course I froze up and made everything awkward and ruined everything. 

Every time I try to do something I screw it up. I feel like I'm not good at anything. My dad and step-mom don't take me seriously. They say I'm lazy because I never do anything but I'm afraid because every time I leave my room I mess something up. I can't make food, can't socialize, video games aren't fun to me anymore because I hate playing alone, I tried skating but I don't have money to buy new equipment and all I have is a tiny Penny board that my feet are too big for, my family expects me to have high grades because I used too be considered the smart one but my grades have fallen so now the one thing I was considered good at is gone and I keep disappointing everyone, the one family member I have that truly loves me is in prison because of an assault charge and everyone in my family hates her, and now I've probably lost another one of my few friends because I can't do anything right.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really want to live but I know I'm not going to commit suicide.

The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships.

Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had)

Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. ‚ÄúGaby, you‚Äôre such a fuck up why are you even alive?‚Äù I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening that‚Äôs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where I‚Äôve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days.

But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think.

Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. 

But sometimes it turns into something a little worse.

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful.

And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me.

"This is a throw away account.

I have never been in a relationship with someone and never had sex or sexual contact with anyone either. I know that isn't really a HORRIBLE thing at all. But I am starting to wonder why?

Story: The only guy I have attracted to a possible relationship has severe depression and general anxieties disorder. He is kind of a shut-in and plays videogames and does drugs when he is not working. That's the extent of his life that I am aware of. I have known him for a few years and at some points durng those years were very close and talked about getting into a serious relationship. At some points, he called me his girlfriend but we never have been REALLY at that point. He used to tell me that he cared about me a lot. He would go through depressive phases and disappear sometimes. When he came back it was always the same. ""I'm sorry, I'm not a good person, I'm bad at relationships, I want to die, etc"".

I still try to get through to him even now. He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway.

I'm starting to wonder less about him and more about me. My friends say that he is not capable of a relationship and it is not a reflection of my worth that he is not receprocating my feelings. But at the same time... if this is all I can get, is this a reflection of me? Am I depressed because I am alone... or am I alone because I am depressed?

Will getting into a relationship with someone make me feel any better? I used to think that I could help him by showering him with my affection and attention. I used to think that if he did this to me, I would feel better and everything would be solved.

For some reason, I think this is foolish now. Maybe it's just growing through the attachment and coming out from the other side in hindsight. Maybe it's just getting tired of him not liking me back. I don't know.

I feel like there is a connection between being alone and being depressed though. I feel like if I would have some thing or someone to support me, I would be more likely to overcome or be motivated to overcome other things. I know that's weak. I just get exhausted and lonely sometimes.

"On NYE, I downloaded a habit tracking app. I had tried to make a paper notebook one but just couldn't be motivated to do it.  Technology to the rescue! Yes, it's only be 3 days. And no new habits have been formed. But it's been a good way to make sure I'm doing all the self care things I've been setting aside when I'm having a bad day: flossing, washing face, brushing teeth, drinking enough water, taking Vitamin D etc. At the end of the day (or before work if I'm working swing shift) I go over the list, see what else I can do. There's a nice little feeling of accomplishment when I press the check mark.

"We are all meaningless and worthless. Our existence as a human species has destroyed the earth to an extent so far that there is no hope for repair. With everyone being greedy, selfish, and weak no one can stand for themselves. People can not be trusted with any information. There is always a way to extract that information. In the worlds history people have been tortured until they release precious information. Some information is serious and some not as important. This means that humans do not have the ability to safely store information. We are animals. We make choices free willingly. No one can be trusted because reality proves humans are sensitive weak fucks. Humans can be broken easily. Nothing but false confidence and pride allows us to live. There is no protection, no certainty or hope that cannot be broken. Im just a spectator. I could put down myself but that would be pointless. If im not feeling any satisfaction in this world then what is the point to keep living. I do not feel any attachment or love, or care. There is no satisfaction or any position energy or feelings that i feel as i wake up. Each day is a forced challenge. The world is not free. Out minds are psychologically abused and used by massive corporations. We do not have free thought. All our actions are watched and criticized. Media skews our perception of reality in the world. There is absolutely no freedom anywhere. Everyone who i look at is just following the schedule a forced schedule and routine that they are just programmed not to think any differently. Everything can change. There is no god. I don‚Äôt want to put any energy into thinking about what is real and what is not. The only thing i seek is a satisfaction in life. Where something makes me feel comfortable and good or happy. This is not short term fake and false bullshit like drugs. Anyone with a working mind will realize those are bad for a number of reasons. But some people just go with what others say. Fuck that. Im not going to make people realize they are all programed and controlled robots. We are forced to do so many things. There is only one thing you can do if you realize everything is pointless and meaningless that is hope. You can hope for something but with out assurance that anything can disappear and be lost what is there to hope for. Your hope can be broken by everything around you. We are animals. Selfish greedy fucking animals. But we have our consciousness that separates us slightly from everything else in this world. But we are still animals. Which means physically we feel fear, sadness, pleasure, and lots of other feelings. It doesn‚Äôt matter where we have come from we will all die. Why does it matter what we do if we will all die. Again what stops us from doing what we want can also be caused by religion. If we believe our actions affect us in another world then we will submit and obey. I don‚Äôt know if there is a god but I don‚Äôt care. If people understood that exact bit of words and realized that. Earth would be a complete shit show. But we have been dominated and controlled because most of us think we can not change some things about the world. Physically that is. We are fearful of physical pain and torment because those physical feelings stop us from being free. Because pain hurts. Humans are traped no one is free. This is why i want to be alone and talk to no one. Very few can understand and realize we are trapped. The way to controll humans is fear and pain but most importantly just not knowing the future and having uncertainty. No one is fearless or painless. Saying you have no feelings is a delusion of your mind. Every single living human has some sort of emotion that stops them from doing what they want. A simple example is our human physical feeling of embarrassment. Or shyness. I don‚Äôt want to tel you what shyness is but embarrassing events are hard to understand why we become embarrassed. Some people become embarrassed by presenting in front of the class. Because our human bodys and minds feel embarrassment. Our body and mind are different although our body has an incrediblly strong indescribable connection to your mind. People are very dumb. Of course usain bolt is on steroids. They say the olyimpics are tested ok great. There are ways to cheat tests. At that high of a level of compitition anyone will do anything for a short term satisfaction. This satisfaction is either from the world or the persons mind. Sometimes both. Achievements in life are only in this life. They might make your mind feel good but its not eternal. Nothing is eternal. Everlasting. Everything can be broken. Safety is a false feeling. There is no real true safety. Unless i do not feel these warm feelings that I should. I don‚Äôt know. Everything is cold, bitter, sad, depressing and i do not feel any satisfaction. Its depression or myself realizing that everything is a delusion and nothing is real. Im not crazy i just understand more than you. Unless my false sense of reality is also skewed to the point of no return. To where i feel no eternal warmth. There is no love that i feel. The only thing that separates my diluted mind is my physical body. I feel emotions like you. Pain, sad, happy, angry, depressed. These are what stops us from being free. The indescribable connection of our minds from our bodys. Our human bodys are what makes us want to live. Our human body is an animal. It controls our mind and our thoughts. We are all sick. Our body is irrational but our mind is rational. But our body will mess with our mind making humans the complex beings that we are. Again i feel no love or satisfaction. Everything i say and do is all from my body. Not my mind. My body controls my mind most of the time. I don‚Äôt feel like i can control my body in a way where it will not affect my mind. Since we have a conciousness we are not gods. Since i have no satisfaction I don‚Äôt want to live but my physical body affects my mind from ending it all. Maybe there is another realm, world, hell or heaven. Who knows. The uncertainty controlls us. We have freedom to sone dregree. Yes our free choices are the smallest most insignificant thing in this world. There is no attachment to anything. Why do i know all of this and feel that way i do. I do not know. I might be missing something. I am missing something its most likely comfort. Not physical comfort but the uncertainty in my mind. Uncertainty is why humans are fearing the future. Its cold dark and what is reality. What is a conciousness. There is no such thing as safety. Uncertainty and us as humans not knowing what the future holds alows religion to control us. Religion is based and controls you with out your thought because you are uncertain. No one knows the future thats what makes churches and religion wealthy and powerful. Because if you make someone hope for something good in the future then you can control them. Our unknowingness allows people to control us. Someone who we think is in authority can control us because of our uncertainty so they tell us what we want to hear. But this is a tool to control the masses. I know so much i have so much to share but my body stops me sometimes. Why do we follow what people say? Because the world has punishments for you. If you did not feel anything physically you would rule this fucking earth. Simple as that. People stop being so dumb. Many people are sheep they just follow. And it is not possible not to follow. Im loosing my thought process as my body physically drifts off to rest",5,Humans can be broken easily
"I had to let go of my dream career, what I was passionate about doing for the rest of my life. You see, for years I was chasing this dream and it finally came knocking at my door. I wanted to be a police officer. I talked to everyone about it. Went on ride a longs. You. and it. I really believed in helping and protecting people. That was my calling. Due to what life throws at you, I was able to start applying in my late 20‚Äôs. And today, at the age of 32, I said no. See, in the 4-5 years it took me to get accepted somewhere, one has to keep going with life. And I did. I got married, got a decent job with decent pay, was able to buy a tiny home. Just life. I have been lucky and I am thankful. 

However, I am slowly dying inside. I can‚Äôt stop running to the bathroom to cry for the last 2 weeks. I am close considering going to the hospital to get stress leave for work. 

So why did I do it? Well in short: a bunch of excuses. Didn‚Äôt feel physically ready for the daily challenges which I was told could lead to my dismissal from the academy; during the time I did exercise and prepared myself I injured myself a lot (knee, back, shoulder), which at the academy could lead to a possible dismissal; also, the academy is a ‚Äúlive-in‚Äù academy, meaning that Monday-Friday I would live at the academy, something my wife was having a lot of emotional problems dealing with that thought; lastly, I would be lying if I said that the whole live-in academy situation did not worry me - it was, and a lot. There has always been something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me when it comes to attachment. I am that guy that cannot say good-bye. And the thought of being away from my wife 5 days a week and dealing with the stresses of an academy really worried me to the point that I knew I would want to come home. So I made the ‚Äúadult‚Äù decision that it would be stupid to go knowing I would not make it and risk my financial stability. 

So now I‚Äôm sitting here. In tears writing this. The last two weeks have literally been like death. I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing that interests me. I am not applying to any other departments because of my age. My body was holding on to this academy and I don‚Äôt have it in me anymore. I really have no purpose. I hate everything about my job - it eats my soul bit by bit. I don‚Äôt have suicidal thoughts. But I do feel like I‚Äôm sitting here for another 40 years waiting for my turn to go. Oh and of course, I don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to but to my wife and I have worn her down a lot. She has been so great. ",2,Well in short: a bunch of excuses

"Hi, I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety issues since i was in middle school and have pretty much hated myself ever since i can remember. I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. 

Really i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject.

1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution)
2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular  ""feelings"" they prevent? 
3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? 
4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.)
5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive?

Thanks for any help/advice anyon can give in advance.",4, my parents never really followed through getting any medication for m

"Hey all.  
Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1,"happen to be mildly autistic, in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded,"
"Well, this person is useless, society doesn't need them, no one does. But that makes these people lonely, and sad, trying to figure out what they did wrong alone, while constantly trying the fact that anything is wrong at all. This is how I've felt for the past two years.

I don't think that everyone has the same view that I just described, but for me, that is as I see it. I am alone, sad and depressed, just hoping that someone would see me, and say more than just a rushed hello as they walk by, back into the mob of the others who followed suit. But I guess that's too much to ask, why would anyone see me as someone to talk to, what could I possibly, say to make someone feel as if i haven't wasted their time?

I don't know how many other people feel the same, but I don't like to burden other with my problem, and that's why I've kept quiet and I know that by posting here I'm completely contradicting what I just said, but, I need help, and going to a forum of people that want to give their help willingly doesn't make me feel like as much of a burden, I hope whoever is reading this shares similar views.

Some days I just want to die;

There'd be no more days of standing by

Wondering why life is full of darkness.

Some days I just want to die,

This pain I can't hardly take...

And I'd rather plunge a stake through my heart

Than keep watching my world fall apart

Piece by crumbled piece.

The world is not my friend or yours,

It feels like nobody truly loves you

Until your lips turn blue and your skin is a lighter hue, your body burned or buried.

And how many more traumas can I carry on my shoulders

Before I stone myself to death with imaginary boulders

Because I feel like a soldier who has no more fight,

No will to live,

No pill to swallow to stop the impending hollow feeling inside?

How many more times can I die

Figuratively, but emotionally, too,

Before I can't handle any more abuse?

How many different ways can I say ""I'm dying"" before someone realizes I am not smiling?

Where can I go when people show their true intentions and I need a place to heal?

Can I come to you?

Together can we steal back our happiness?

Can we give each other something real, something normal, something lovely?

If the answer is no,

I hope you'll simply smother me

And put to rest my aches and pains.

Drain my body drop by drop

Please don't stop or call the cops...

Just do me a favor,

Erase the stains I leave behind

And find a way to smile and shine when I'm gone.

I love you unconditionally

I want to give you the best of me

Show you you're my soul

But I feel a gaping hole in my heart

A wound that stretches further apart every time I open my eyes

The size forever growing

Please, please, please

Please hear my cries

Please give me a chance to speak.

Don't mistake me for weak,

Just know I've fought for so long

And I'm trying so hard to be strong

But some days I just want to die.",5,Wondering why life is full of darkness

"Hello, my name is Pranav. I am an 18 year old guy, living in India, currently in the last year of school with about 50 days to go before my final examinations. A lot depends upon my performance in these exams - most importantly, my dream of studying in Canada, and the image and respect that I've built for myself all these previous years.

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

**NOW,** here I am. A well-endowed and capable human being, with tools and knowledge. I know what to do. What action to take. But I feel shitty all the time and keep wandering off to wasting time. I got rid of my computer but I cannot do away with video games.

I feel shitty, stupid, guilty, insecure, helpless and like a failure. I am on a self-made ride for self-destruction. I have the tools and **ONE LAST SHOT AT SALVATION**. But I am guilty of self-sabotage [I have all the information that I need but I just can't break free from the vicious cycle of inaction and also **I keep gorging new information, especially spiritual stuff** even though I don't need it!]. I need help. Help and support that none around me can provide (without being judgemental). I feel lost and at the mercy of fate.

Thank you for hearing me out.",2,"am not at all prepared for the exams, For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons,procrastination, severe escapism, depression"

"Since I don't really know where to start, might as well go with the grief portion and build outwards.

My mother died almost a year ago now. We're a small family, me an only child, and I am very lucky to have a close relationship with my parents, my mom especially. She has always been the type to 'mom' me and she was an emotional support that I never truly appreciated.

Her death was sudden and unexpected because, as she did, she hid her own issues from me to lessen my burden. I still remember getting the call out of nowhere and my world crashing around me. While I am blessed with an amazing extended family, it's just Dad and me to carry on and he doesn't really get it. His go-to is dark humour which I frankly can't handle and I don't know if I ever will. He is also much more prepared for this, having known my mom was struggling as she was. He also doesn't understand mental illness, specifically depression, except to say that I should try being happier.

Which leads to the other side of this wombo-combo. I'm in a new city for school and the fall before my mom died, my only circle of friends (who also happen to be my co-workers) cast me out in a spectacular gaslighting endeavor that destroyed any self-confidence I had. I was told things I felt going on around me were all in my head, that I was imagining tension that wasn't there, and I should just chill.

Fast-forward to 2 days before my mom died and I get a request to meet from one of the more vocal of the group. I was on the phone with my mom, the last phone call I would ever have with her, and told her I had to go meet with this person. In that meeting, I'm told that everything I thought was going on, was actually going on (contrary to the months of gaslighting prior) and that I'm essentially a terrible person who deserved it. But, this person was willing to show me mercy and permit me to re-join this circle on the condition that I change everything about my personality.

I was so lonely, so isolated, that I consented. I began to believe the lies about how horrible I was and within 24 hours, I was on the floor of my apartment, crying and trying to determine the best way to end my life because I saw no reason for a worthless, horrible person like myself to exist. I had decided to go get a knife when the phone rang with an unexpected call from a friend back home which broke through my thoughts long enough to break the cycle in my head.

I wrote to our collective supervisor about the situation and went to lay down as I was having intense chest pain. The next day, I woke up and my mother had died of heart failure/heart attack (we didn't have an autopsy done).

So here I am, back in my isolation. My supervisor has ignored my repeated attempts to bring this issue to light as the situation has not improved at work at all in the last year. I've hidden myself away in my apartment, and I feel like I'm dying inside.

I have so much guilt over cutting my phone call short with my mom to deal with this insane mind game. I have anger over these people stealing my energy from what's important. I still feel worthless for being unable to get past this. I just feel so much pain. I wish with all my being my mom was still here and I feel like I'm disappointing her by being unable to get my life back on track. I feel as though I'm drowning on the inside and no matter who I tell or what I say, all I hear is that 'you can do this' or 'just stay positive'. I am positive, and I can be positive, but that doesn't help when my depression sets in and my heart is breaking.

See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. 
But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. 
It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" 
But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to.

I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh.

"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night? 
I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. 
But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? 
But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living.

She loves him.. She loves her boyfriend of 2 years and there's nothing I can do about that. She loves a man who abuses her in every way possible.

I just can't understand why you choose to be abused rather than be with me.

I can't get you out my head but why would I want to. My reason for smiling is my reason for depression lately.

"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago.

She says she felt like a burden to the people around her.  Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they don‚Äôt understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all.

We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest.  I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm.  I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second.  I‚Äôve never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on.  Even though I‚Äôve been one of her closest friends for years.  She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. 



She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her.   And I believe her. 


But what if this happens again?  What if she has another rough trot?  What am I to do, I feel like I won‚Äôt be enough to stop her.

Just a little back story of myself: I‚Äôve have depression and anxiety for 10 years after the loss of a parent at 14 but never sought immediate treatment. Last year was when I was official diagnosed. But anyways, 2017 was a really rough year for my anxiety and depression, as I‚Äôm sure others can probably empathize, and I kept experiencing one issue after another and it‚Äôs just completely drained me at this point.

Now this issue that‚Äôs in front of me is that the three of us are in our early 20s but I‚Äôm not planning on having children no time soon nor do I have much experience with them but I love babies. However when they both told me about this very exciting news that I know meant a lot to them, Instantly triggered me.

I was very scared of losing my two close friends because I know I feel like I‚Äôll never see them as much and things will change because they‚Äôll be busy with their babies also the idea of motherhood terrifies me right now.

"Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed : 

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",2,"a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce"

All of this is making me incredibly sad. The drugs are the only fun thing I do. And video games occasionally but they dont entertain me as much as they did 2/3 years back.

Im 19 years old and I am thinking about calling a psychologist monday morning next week. Mainly because of my social anxiety and anger attacks (another emotionally-selfdestructive problem of mine), but I feel like I am slipping into a depression aswel. Any thoughts?

Ps: thankyou for reading all of this.

"How do people even do it? TD;LR: I'm reaching out to the depression community on here because I relate to a lot of you. 

I'm at a point in my life where I have like, virtually no friends. My current best friend (I don't know if I'm as important to her as she is to me but I've made talking to her a habit and she really talked me through a lot of my problems and kept me going during the worst of my depression even though we've never met in real life &amp; she lives in another continent. I'm afraid I'm driving even her slowly away, or maybe she's just busy with life. I'm in a bad place where I'm practically doing nothing so I'm always free &amp; my loneliness has made me so clingy that I can no longer bother her with my bullshit. I would love to reach out to other lonely people online and have long conversations about life and so many people have so many online friends these days but nobody stays. Even if I get along with someone online the 'relationship' is short lived &amp; then we don't talk anymore. I know there's a lot of people out there who feel the same way I just wish we could connect so I could feel less fucking alone.  ",4,no longer bother her with my bullshit.
"We are generations of people who gave up. And there are many reasons why but I don't think that we are the reason. 

Jordan Peterson talked in one of his lectutes about a 2 year critical time  right around the age of 1 and 2 where we need human interaction the most. Thats where we learn the most social standarts. What I think is that since we stopped living in villigas and small communities we lack heavily in human interactions. There are places like kindergarden but they are too late. In germany there is a kita wich is for even younger children. The main thought for these is that the parents can go to work. That the wrong goal. These should be for social interaction teaching children how to get along. And how to deal with their own emotions by putting them in diffenet situations in fun games. 

Also children and teenager should be forced to get human interaction. I mean if you k ow how to meet new people and how to communicate with them because you are too anxious (as me) to do the first step then it will be extreamly difficult to get better in this on your own!

Also I think our world looks just dirty and filthy. That is no enviourment to be happy around and when you live in a place like me (germany) where it rains almost all day you are fucked if you are allready depressed. 

What I also think thaz we are missing is that we need proper educations in basic hygene and how important it is. I see too many small children running arou d with really bad breath. Or they just smell aweful in general. If they won't build a bsaic hygene routine now it will be extreamly difficult in the future. 

And finally we lack on proper thinking. As carlsagan said ""science is a way of thinking"" But we never get educated in this. They all expect us to know how to think scientificly. We should just have one  class where they give us problems sometimes basic and sometimes hard but they should never be such problem wich yoz can learn. Everyproblem need to be diffrent and should all be solvable by thinking scientificly. 

I think if all people had this basic skill sets allot of people would be less depressed and more motivated to do thinks because you would know how to solve problems wven if they were totally new and with unknow parameters for you.

Sorry for the long text but Idk where to post this else where then here since this is one way to prevent most of the depressions (like mine).

If I got that when I was younger then I would be whole diffrent person. ",4,children and teenager should be forced to get human interaction

As my title says, depression has ruined my life. I've just broken up with my fianc√© because she found out I cheated on her. I know that makes me pure scum but it's made me realise how much I'm struggling to cope with life and that I need (and am getting) help. 

I've bottled up my depression for years which lead to ""episodes"". These ranged from assaults (which lead to nights in the cells), drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fits of anger, compulsive lying, erratic behaviour, and, at my lowest, cheating. Each of these came with extreme lows and ever increasing suicidal thoughts. I realised something needed to change soon or I would end it - it was that simple. 

It was my ex that told me to get help. It was my mum that came with me to my first counselling session (2nd one later this week) and to the GP (doctor). Both of these experiences were terrifying but extremely helpful. The GP is going to be putting me on antidepressants as he explained that I needed help with the low feelings I was having. I go back tomorrow once the GP has checked that a previous medical condition won't affect my treatment. 

I'm not sure I'm going to get through this as I'm still thinking about suicide almost every hour, but I'm going to try. I'm not willing to throw away the best 5 years of my life for nothing and I hope when I get better that I can try and rekindle my relationship and give my perfect girl the life she deserves. 

If anyone else is in a dark place right now please reach out to someone - a family member, a friend, a counsellor, a doctor, anyone that can give you the support you need.

Cliffs:
- I thought it was going to be something more 
- I wasn‚Äôt fullfilled 
- following your dreams doesn‚Äôt make you happy
- You are sold a lie to get you to consumed 

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasn‚Äôt really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didn‚Äôt really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself ‚Äúhey do you even enjoy what you are doing‚Äù and to be honest I didn‚Äôt. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasn‚Äôt motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I don‚Äôt give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isn‚Äôt for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasn‚Äôt was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasn‚Äôt happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other people‚Äôs lives on tv or social media and say to themselves ‚ÄúI want that life‚Äù I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying ‚Äúyou are just depressed bro‚Äù honestly I don‚Äôt think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) that‚Äô it‚Äôs not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole ‚Äúquit your job to travel the world thing‚Äù might sound cool and all but I promise you it‚Äôs not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.",2,quiting my job to travel

I have several passions such as writting, video games, and cars. Butbi am not good at any of these things so it just ultimately seems ridiculous. I feel bad for my wife because I am extremely bad at expressing any emotion and mostly just hang out somewhere in the middle instead of being excited or supportive.

I've felt like I'm a bit off for a long time but I have avoided seeking any help out of shame or fear. My job won't allow for me to seek mental help without transferring me and I've always been rather prideful.

I was working for us, we were talking about getting married. It was a bit early but we were set on having kids. The thought of having a kid and family to take care of motivated me so much. And now that I don't have that I feel so pointless. It caused a lot of philosophical questioning in my head about life, and I don't even wanna be alive at most times. Some days I feel so positive, some days I think about jumping off of a bridge. It's been 6 lonely months, without a job, now living at my dad's while he's constantly pestering me about getting a job. I've posted on here so many times and people keep telling me just to move on and hangout with friends but it's not that fuckin easy. I have 0 motivation to do anything and I feel so pathetic. You would think that if I'm gonna be alive I should at least do something with my life even if I wanna die, but I don't. I just sit here and listen to music all day. I have dreams but they feel so impossible that I don't even try. I don't even think anybody is gonna read this far.

"I believe I have struggled  with depression and anxiety for a long time but the past year or so seems to have dramatically increased it. 

So here's the story: 
I had been working a job at a tire shop which I didn't not enjoy with people I didn't get along with. I was seeing a girl who was in an open marriage who eventually became my best friend and biggest supporter.
I was giving the opportunity by a buddy's parents to join the merchant marines and go to the seafearers school in piney point. I was not sure if I would like it but his mom was very persistent that I do it and since joining the military was always a dream of mine but was out of the question due to my past, I agreed.
I have always separation anxiety for some reason, even though I have never felt particularly close to much of anyone or anything. I knew I would miss my family and friends and skydiving (which at one time was the only thing that really made me happy) and booze but I went into the seafearers program with all the promises of a wonderful, rewarding career making more money that I could spend. 
Well, needless to say, the ""school"" was not the prestigious, academy in which I was told. It was more or less a free labor, brain washing institution full of ignorant criminals and, pretty sure, illegal immigrants, ran by a union which I'm pretty sure is a mob front.  None the less, I got through the first phase of the school. The girl I had been seeing at home was very supportive and we texted everyday as we had for the entire year we had known each other. I was working out everyday and was reading a few self help books to try to help cope with being away from everything at home. 
Immediately after the first phase of school, you are sent directly on to a ship which I was assigned with two others from my class, one was a guy I got along with pretty well and the other was the biggest piece of shit I have ever met in my life. There were good and bad days but to be honest I really wasn‚Äôt into it, working everyday and only making $35/day however, I kept telling myself that it was a good experience and that it would be better next time. We did have shitty internet on the ship so I could communicate with my family, which was rare, but again the girl would text me everyday.
So  that tour was done after 90 days being on the ship in the middle east. Time to go home, finally.
I went home with almost no money, still living with my parents but after over 7 months, was ready to see everyone again and the girl I had left behind and to finally skydive again. This is were things turned for the worse. I soon realized that the  warm welcome home I had hoped for wasn‚Äôt what I had coming. Most of the time I sat around my house drinking alone frustrated with myself, my finances, the fact that I was 26 with almost no money, no real friends, still living at my parents who are having to pay my bills while I‚Äôm trying to get through the rest of this program, still hoping that it will be worth wild. The girl I had been talking to the past year was always busy and seemed to never have much time to hang out and we began arguing more and more because, being the jealous person I am, wanted to be with her all the time. I kept skydiving on the weekends but eventually, it became frustrating to me as well and lost most of the joy it once brought me. There were many time I would hope for a malfunction that would let me go in or times when I would consider simply not pulling. 
After about a month I went back to the ‚Äúschool‚Äù to do the third phase. I got through it and even through all our issues me and the girl who I was now very much in love with, still texted back and forth everyday. Adding  to my self hatred, I was in love with a married woman. Everyday at the school, my class seemed to be in trouble for something. Losing the few privileges that were available to us and getting assigned daily extra detail. After two long months, it was over and time to go home and await shipping assignments. I was pretty sure I wanted nothing to do with this union at this point but didn‚Äôt want to let my buddy‚Äôs parents down, they had put a lot of effort into me doing this and really wanted me to go through with it. So I decided to go home and wait for them to give me my assignment. At this point, it has been almost a year since I have made any real money and having my parents and grandmother paying the few bills I had which made me feel terrible. 
When I got home, the same problems as last time. I felt alone, completely alone. 
There was a part of me that was looking forward to shipping again. As this time I would actually be making a wage. After about a month of waiting, I was assigned a ship which I was hoping to get to see some interesting ports and make some money. Well got on and found out there is no internet and the only way to contact anyone was through a terrible company email program. Found that my wage was basically bullshit with my overtime rate being $12/hour and then I saw the ship schedule, fucking middle east again with only a few ports on the way that we were allowed to get off at for maybe an hour or two. On top of that, the cooks were awful. There was hardly a week that went by were someone wasn‚Äôt sick from the food. Then, about 2 weeks into the voyage crossing the Atlantic,  my laptop charger was surged and ruined so I couldn‚Äôt access the four terabytes of movies and books on my hard drive I had downloaded for the trip. I was able to get off in a port in Italy to try to find another charger but ended up having to buy a whole new computer just for the charger I needed.
Somehow while at sea, my debit card had been used in China for almost $800. I was able to have that taken care of but my card was canceled giving me no access to my money until I could get home to activate the new card they had sent me.
Then we got stuck in Beaumont Texas due to hurricane Harvey for weeks. One night, after things were beginning to open back up, me and another guy went out on the town. To get in and out of the port from the ship, you have to be escorted by port police from the ship to the gate and vis versa. Upon returning to the ship, I was sitting in the backseat in the middle with the other guy in the front passenger seat and the port police officer driving. The idiot cop wrecked the police truck directly into a concrete support beam sending my face flying into the steel divider of the police truck busting up my face and sending me to the hospital. After getting stitched up and a few days bac on the ship, I was eventually sent home.
Back home again, I was sent to a doctor and complained about upper back pain that radiated into my neck and shoulder pain. They told me to do physical therapy 3 times a week at their facility for 4 weeks without them taking x-rays or anything. I did that reluctantly, constantly asking to be referred to a specialist to have an mri done on my upper back and shoulder. After the therapy the doctor finally ordered an mri on September 25th. It took me a month of fighting back and forth between the shipping company and the union insurance company to get the mri  and finally got it done October 25th, the day after my birthday. Finally, I thought but come to find out, he ordered an mri on my upper neck. Not my back or my shoulder. At my follow up appointment, when confronted about it, he assured me that it was suppose to be my shoulder and back but after leaving the room for 3 hours, he returned to say that he thought my neck was more of an issue than  my shoulder at the time. My neck only hurt from the pain that was in my back which I made sure to express from day one. I asked if he was going to reorder the mri to actually look at the problem to which he replied no that I would have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life because there was nothing else he could do and he cleared me to go back to work even though I could hardly move my head, sit up straight, or lift my shoulder.
Over the next month I had hurt my knee somehow but hoped it would eventually get better. It would lock up if I bent it and the only way to get it unlocked was to go down to ground on my knees and sit back on my feet. The girl I was in love with at this point and I continued to see each other but seemed like less and less, maybe a few times a month. We went out one day I had decided to cut back on the drinking and got very drunk to the point I had to cut her off and take her back to my house. She wanted to have sex but I told her no because she was so drunk but she kept trying. She started telling me things like ‚Äúwith you it‚Äôs different, I don‚Äôt feel like  a piece of meat like everyone else‚Äù I asked her who is everyone else and she told me she gets paid to have sex and she was a prostitute. I didn‚Äôt believe her but was insistent, trying to find a so called website she was apparently on and showing me text messages from people she said she was only friends with before where she has been sending nude pictures and explicit messages. When she woke the next morning I confronted her about it to which she had no recollection and admitted to seeing and having sex with multiple other men and women but not the whole being a prostitute or getting paid for sex which she still denies to this day. Being the only person I have ever felt like I could talk to, I still talk to her, which makes me hate myself. 
Over the next few weeks I hurt my other knee and had surgery on both meniscus. I was told I would be back walking in a few days with full recovery in a few weeks before I went in for surgery.  I went in for surgery and my mom had taken me and the girl that broke my heart asked to be there, I agreed to it and they both waited during the surgery. I woke up in leg braces being told that it was worse than they thought and that I would be in leg braces for up to 10 weeks. No skydiving, no rock climbing, no running or working out, no walking except to and from the bathroom with crutches. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.
Today is the end of week 4 of being confined to my bed in my parents house to which I live. Only being able to go out for therapy and almost no one has came to visit me. The girl has a few times but it‚Äôs awkward and I keep trying to find a way to forgive her and some way to trust her, why, I guess I feel like she‚Äôs all I have. My mom has been having to do pretty much everything for me which I can‚Äôt stand. I sit here all day in bed frustrated, bored, depressed, worrying, hating everything that has happened, wondering what could possibly be next until I finally just give up and start downing any alcohol I can get my hands on. Back and shoulder still messed up. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about being able to see another doctor about that issue. Also, about a week before surgery, my clutch went out in my car. I ordered a new clutch and flywheel and rushed to get it put in before my surgery. I did but after a few hours I noticed something wasn‚Äôt right. I took the transmission back out and discovered that the paint on the flywheel melted and let the bolts holding it to the crank come loose and one snapped off. So now my car is torn apart in my dads garage possibly needing a new crankshaft.

I am constantly trying to tell myself that there is someone else out there that is way worse off than me which I know is true and that is shouldn‚Äôt complain and that things will get better but at this point, I‚Äôm no longer so sure.

"I had my college schedule planned out for the whole year.  One class, an elective for my minor, completely took my by surprise.  I had no idea what was happening the first day and the material was not enjoyable (the reason that I took it).  There was a 10 minute presentation in a foreign language that was 15% of the grade and I couldn't handle it.  I just dropped and I feel like a complete failure.  I filled in the space with a class for my major, so I'm not behind, but I feel so stupid, and I'm worried that whenever that prof and the students from that class see me in the future, that they'll think I'm dumb and don't deserve to be in their classes.",2,"One class, an elective for my minor, completely took my by surprise, had no idea what was happening the first day and the material was not enjoyable, (the reason that I took it), There was a 10 minute presentation in a foreign language that was 15% of the grade and I couldn't handle it,  I just dropped and I feel like a complete failure "
"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1,ejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed

"Hello everyone, 

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...

"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

I wish I didn't exist to trouble other people. So, apologies for having you listen to my rant; I have no idea what I was hoping to achieve here, looking back.",4,ldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party

"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven.

"*There is so much great feedback on Reddit and I'm really hoping to benefit from it please. The following is my stack and some background information.*



I saw an Adult ADHD Specialist last month and he said while I've been treated primarily for *ADHD-PI* (diagnosed by Psychologist and follow ups with Psychiatrists) it is NOT the root cause of my *depression* and *anxiety.* My ADHD-PI and Anxiety are result from my depression ...mind blown ...I've been running the wrong way for 10yrs now?!



Disappointed as I really wasn't expecting this; I wrestled with it for a bit but then finally accepted it and am moving fwd. My doctor read the report and added 25mg of Aventyl to my bedtime stack. A couple weeks later my family was worried as I was severely depressed and upset for many reasons. I saw another doctor and he doubled the 25mg of Aventyl to 50mg and introduced Siv-Escitalopram (10mg) to be taken in my morning stack. 

    

I'm a little worried as he and the pharmacists warned me about **[Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)**. I also have been told/read that if you mess with your brain chemistry too much it could wake up a dormant bipolar disorder in you, that is if bipolar disorder is in your family history - and it is.

    

I don't drink often (1-2 drinks a week), eat 3 balanced meals (eggs and asparagus, bulletproof coffee, protein and veggies, aim for low sugar), and jog every other day.

Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there.

"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state. However, I realized a few days ago, maybe a week, that IOP doesn't give a shit about me. They just care about my insurance copay.

I am tired. I realized that I will never get better. My life is shit. I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter?

I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem.

"So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late.  Anyway, here we go.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be neurotypical.  It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know?  And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point.

&amp;nbsp;

Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed.  You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy.  For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option.  I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be a whole person.  I'm not motivated.  There's nothing I really want from life.

I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... 

I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated.

"Hello. To start I‚Äôll say that my depression has always been a peaks and troughs kind of mindset in which good and bad events flip the trigger. Since high school, however there‚Äôs been a lingering perpetual sadness and loneliness.

I‚Äôve never been the person that connects well with other people. I‚Äôve had small groups of friends and a lot of times I have trouble finding a deeper feeling of a strong relationship with those people, like they are surface level. 

Then there was a girl...
I met her freshman year of college and quickly we were together and happy. Whenever I think of times where my sadness and anxiety was completely irrelevant to me, it was times with her. Our third year of college, though she went abroad and broke it off. She tells me how she felt codependent with me and needed her independence, but loves me. This was the first of multiple times this has happened, and I fell into a very dark place. 

She came back, though for senior year, and we quickly got back together, the way things were.

When we graduated she wanted to move to a new city she fell in love with when interning for a summer. I had opportunity in the city we were in, and so we went separate ways. We stayed in touch for a few months until, for the second time, I got a call with the same speech I got when she went abroad. I thought that was it and I would move on. Sad, but I needed to try. I dragged through my life bitter at the place I was living and the thin to non-existent relationships I had with people. I even dated someone a few months later, but I was never happy with her, yet I stuck with it and got broken up with again. There I was, hurt by someone I didn‚Äôt care too much about but at the fact I was alone and can‚Äôt find a relationship quite like before. 

Now to a few months ago. A friend of both me and my college ex catches up with her unexpectedly when she was in town for a few days. She tells them she thinks about me sometimes and what could have been...and that she‚Äôd be happy if I got in touch. I pounced on this opportunity. I didn‚Äôt go into this expecting anything to come of it other than companionship, but as before, it fell back into how we always were together.

A month ago she calls me upset. There‚Äôs another guy where she is living and is torn between me and him. She tells me to ‚Äúclaim what is mine‚Äù and if I moved closer to her she could promise me we could try again. I tell her how I feel and what comes out of it is a trip to see her for New Years. I go to see her and I have never felt less depressed in my life. Being with her made me want to actively try to live happier, healthier, and work harder. 

It‚Äôs hard to leave to come home though and both of us are anxious about what will happen. The day came when we had to talk about it and basically I felt like I needed to make a big play. It was either going to work, or I would go down knowing I‚Äôd try. I told her how I felt when I was with her and that I was willing to move there and work everything out. I told her I loved her and it‚Äôs what I want to take a chance for......all I received, was for the third time, was indecisiveness and doubt. She said she didn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs willing up everything she built from scratch in her new City and doesn‚Äôt want to fall in her old feeling of codependency. I felt defeated and lost.

I know this was a long post, and I appreciate anyone who made it this far. The conclusion is I have never felt more alone and isolated in both the lack of relationships I have and the place I live. I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know where I belong or the purpose I serve, and the girl I loved I wasn‚Äôt good enough for, which feels like it transcends to everyone I put an effort into. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm looking guidance or just anyone to listen, but all in all, thanks for reading.

"We are all constantly searching for happiness in life and this is nothing more then the love emotion.

Why is it so important and powerful though?

The love emotion gives us so much in our lives that most are not aware of.

It is the ultimate emotion that gives us energy, motivation, happiness, intellect and clarity, health, makes us feel whole and contempt, increases our intuition that will give us the right questions to ask, give us the answers we need and ultimately push us towards our true personal purpose.

Did you realize it did all of this for us??

We constantly need to refill this love energy in ourselves without even knowing it. Most of us do it through the wrong ways that will have it fluctuating up and down causing an imbalance within ourselves.
We can do this from manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on.

It does not have to be this way though and is not the best route. We can constantly have the love emotion in us and can do it in a beautiful way with ourselves without it fluctuating.

How can we hold the love emotion naturally?

We can receive and hold this beautiful emotion in us through the beauty of the natural world.
Through nature, the environment, animals, real food, ourselves, and even people if we do it the correct way. The energy is abundant and unlimited so it is not needed to manipulate others for it or do it in the non-beneficial ways.

Allow yourself to embrace the beauty of the natural world and have the love fill yourself completely.

Let go of your ego as it will just try to survive and destroy love.
Where love lives, ego cannot survive. It's only goal is to bring you down through selfish means and scare you into thinking love is not the answer.

Love is truly magical when you allow it to completely engulf yourself.

When you apply it correctly you can have all the benefits mentioned above. You will magnify in life and have an aura that will attract all the most beautiful things you ever wanted in you're life.",5,"manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on."

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens. Things just never really made a whole lot of sense to me. I don't think I ever really understood the concept of school, y'know? I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way.  I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason.  I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough.  All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day.  For the first time in my life, I failed a test.  I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression.  I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything...  I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others.  Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.  I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly.  I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all.  Nothing crisp, anyways.  I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here.  My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me.  My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.

"I tried to post this on a proof reading sub but it's pretty inactive. 

After a long struggle I recently decided to seek medical help and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. 

Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. 

But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success. 

Here is a link to guidelines and my finished petition: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11g3mmfG5uUOe5wCMQZlUZKpZgzp-HZRf

All i ask is for someone to please proof read the short petition for me. Or offer suggestions. Its due Jan the 9th but I want to finish it and submit it ASAP.

"More than ever, my motivation is just gone. I've been 'unhappy' for roughly 3 years (I've refrained from calling myself depressed since I haven't actually been professionally diagnosed with anything since I'm too afraid to get help). I don't feel like waking up anymore. I wake up briefly, then sleep until 3 in the afternoon. I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.
I don't feel like eating. I have no appetite. I'm losing weight when I'm already too thin. Because of my social anxiety, I've isolated myself from everyone I used to know-- and now I have nobody.

My feelings have only gotten worse, especially over the last two months. I've cried so many times over the past few days. I haven't taken care of myself at all.
I don't think I'd ever bring myself to take my own life, but the thought of randomly being put out of my misery seems so refreshing.
But I'm too afraid to speak up about it to anybody. I don't want to worry anyone. And the times that I have tried to subtly cry for help, I've only been responded to with ""Go home, lie down, drink some tea, and read a book-- you might feel better!"" but it doesn't work like that.

Im 17. I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  ""how to help my teenager suicidal son"", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

I've never told anyone about my feelings, both ending my life and seeking help iin my parents induce me too much fear.

"When I was in high-school, I screwed up any and every opportunity to get into Ivy League by getting suspended.

I also just lost my scholarship to my current college because I didn't get the minimum GPA required this past semester. Though my dad is paying for my education, I don't want to burden him unnecessarily. So yes, it pains me that I lost the scholarship. And my first real girlfriend (of nearly a year) just left me in the middle of that semester. She's not coming back, either.

Guys, my resting bitch-face is turning into resting Slav-face. (No offense to genetically Slavic people...That was just the best analogy I could come up with.) That's how terrible I feel. Nothing has made me smile genuinely for more than a second--and the best ""smile"" that I've even had lately was just changing my current face into what would be my neutral expression if I were happy. Not even memes make me laugh like they should. Not even when someone else shows me one, it doesn't; and I'm not faking it because that would honestly require too much effort out of me.

I lack so much energy that it takes me thirty minutes to get out of bed. And no, I'm not on my phone or anything. I just lay there. I don't even think about anything while I lay, either; I quite literally lay in bed for thirty minutes and struggle to actually get up. And what's worse is that I don't wake up by my own volition. My dad comes in and wakes me up. Speaking of that...My own dad told me on Christmas Eve that I was ruining Christmas by being lazy and noncompliant with him. He yelled at me and told me that I was to ""change [my] attitude"" or leave the house. It's not an attitude. I don't know what to otherwise call it, though.

What's worse is that my dad hasn't let me outside of the house for the past three weeks since my break from college started. He told me ""You're going to be productive while you're on your break. The only way to succeed in college is by doing more than what's required of you."" So I've been reading my English book two months in advance and answering all the guided-reading questions that correspond to each passage from dawn until dusk. I've gotten barely any sunlight whatsoever--and this only because I have a window in my room. And I haven't gotten exercise at all.

Besides the lethargy that I've been feeling, my metabolism has went to absolute shit. I haven't eaten more than a meal-and-a-half each day...and I'm talking about ""normal-person""-sized meals: normal portions...and I'm bigger than a normal person. I weigh, like, 100 kilograms (226 lbs)...yet I've been eating like an anorexic person. In fact, I was sick earlier this vacation and vomited anything that went into my system. I literally couldn't even eat a sandwich for two straight days. And I've been sick with standard cold/flu symptoms for the past week or so.

Even my sleeping schedule is off. A normal, healthy person sleeps eight hours every day. I've tended to sleep much longer than that...and I still don't feel well-rested at all. No amount of earplugs to drown out external noise nor sleeping-masks to prevent sunlight from awakening me has actually led me to a good night's rest. I tried NyQuil, too...but that didn't give me rest. It just drained my energy and forced me to sleep. It didn't give me rest at all, though.

If I can't change this...this intense feeling of malaise, I'm not sure what I can do. I guess I'll just go to my J-term class and see if I can't pretend that it's all O.K. Maybe I'll suddenly feel better if I just can pretend...hopefully...

But the thing is that this sadness is beyond tears; beyond simple and vague melancholia. It is an emptiness; a void. Since my mother isn't really in the picture (and so only my father is really here), I guess I could say in German: ""Ich f√ºhle mich mutterseelenallein."" And I do feel deserted. But I know I deserved it. I deserve everything bad that's ever happened to me and that will ever happen to me, because I'm such a screw-up. Even my own existence is a mistake. I was adopted at birth from two people who had a one-night-stand and no intentions of ever getting married with each other. Okay, yeah, they loved me and wanted me to have life. Thanks to them.

And thanks to my adoptive mom and dad for having fed, clothed, and sheltered me...but my adoptive dad doesn't love me like he should. He wanted a child whom he could be proud of. When that didn't work for my older brother, he focused all of his yelling and threats on me...and I've been forced into subordination or else exile. He's made me into something that I'm not, and I'm not comfortable. But I don't even know what I am, because I've been forced so much to be something that I'm not. But this isn't about how my dad fails to acknowledge mental health issues; this is about how much of a terrible person I am--and I am very much such a person.

I won't go into the details, but the reason I got suspended back in high-school was because I made an ironic and edgy joke about killing myself. (Say what you will about me; any rebuke just furthers the point that I am the scum of the Earth.) No, I wasn't suicidal. I was just into extremely offensive humor at the time.

I also am a long-time user of pornography. I have seen unclad women since I was ten. Now I‚Äôm eighteen and have the worst imaginable sexual kinks. I‚Äôm so fucked-up that I have a thing for torture and pain. And at this point, there can be no argument that I might ever do anything BDSM as an act of love. At best, I‚Äôd do it as an act of self-pleasure because I so lack love--although even if someone would want to do it with me, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even be able to. I‚Äôve had rapid bursts of sexual urges followed by long (multi-day) periods of not having the slightest feeling of wanting to relieve myself since this break started. I‚Äôm sure that any girl with enough sex-drive to even tolerate BDSM would want it several times a day. So I wouldn‚Äôt even satisfy such a girl.

And, despite the above, I believe in God. I don‚Äôt want to do anything outside of marriage, which further proves my fucked-upness. Besides the fact that, even from a secular point-of-view, I‚Äôm fucked-up, I now am doubly so fucked-up from a Christian perspective. And all happiness is supposed to come from God. So I guess I‚Äôm so fucked-up that not even God wants to make me happy or something. I guess He wants to emphasize how much of a misbegotten shit I am.

As someone of illegitimate birth--as someone who could have been slaughtered just as easily as adopted--I am against the notion of abortion. In all ways, I am against it; even in cases of rape. I believe in the forgiveness of others (and yet I wonder whether I, too, will be forgiven?) because I find abortion to be punishment against a child for the sins of its parents. Someone who could have become a very close friend to me has just blocked me on Facebook because of my stance. I guess, besides not being good enough for Ivy League nor for affordable college nor for kindness from my father nor for happiness from God, I‚Äôm also not good enough even for friends. Literally everyone who likes me doesn‚Äôt know me whatsoever. Anyone whom I ever hang out with starts to drift away from me after maybe two hang-out-sessions. And I‚Äôm heavily introverted: I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúlook for new friends‚Äù like that--but besides that it‚Äôs socially uncomfortable for me to seek others in such a manner, it‚Äôs also futile. I am unloved and have almost zero confidence that I will ever be loved--especially not by myself.

The worst part of this all is that a hobby of mine is composing and playing music. At the absolute maximum, I‚Äôve done that for perhaps three hours out of three weeks. (And I feel as though it would be the same even if my dad would let me do whatever I wanted.) If I weren‚Äôt such a disappointment and a mistake, I would easily do it for six hours every day...but, alas, I am a mistake. So I haven‚Äôt even been doing the things I like to do...

And at this point, after much reflection on how bad of a person I am, I'm not sure whether I'll be happy again. I‚Äôm not asking for help, though. I just wanted to...You know what? I don‚Äôt even know why I wrote this, nor why I bothered to. I don‚Äôt care about support. Love doesn‚Äôt exist in my life like it does in others‚Äô. I don‚Äôt even care about getting it off my chest. I just felt like having my voice heard, perhaps.

"So I posted this on facebook to share with the handful of friends I know that are also suffering from mental illness. Unfortunately it was met with a wave of ""GET HELP"" messages that were not warranted or asked for. 

So I'm going to share it here with you folks and hope that it helps at least one person.

_____________________________________________________

I want to share something with all of my friends that are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental illness. It's something I've been trying to do since I moved and I'm making it my official new years resolution. I won't promise it will work for you. We're all different, but it has helped me.

Every day pick one productive thing to get done. Just ONE. Even if it's something insignificant. Especially on the days you just want to stay in bed and wish for death and you can't find any motivation to do anything else.

Even something as simple as washing your hair. Wash that one pan you've been letting 'soak' in the sink for the last three days. Do one load of laundry and actually fold it and put it away. Sweep your kitchen floor. Vacuum your living room. Wipe your kitchen counters. Just one thing, even if it only takes 5 minutes.

Sometimes you may even find that overcoming that initial inertia gives you enough energy and motivation to do more. Maybe you clean the whole kitchen instead of just doing that one dish. But don't worry if it doesn't. As long as you do the one thing.

Just doing one productive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless.  And maybe when you come home from work and walk into a slightly cleaner kitchen you'll have a little feeling of satisfaction that is often elusive to those of us suffering with mental illness.

It's not a cure or anything. It might not even work for you. I don't know. I just wanted to share something that has helped me a little. Maybe it can help you too.

_____________________________________________________

That's what I posted on facebook but I want to lay down some rules for this exercise. 

1. **Don't** make a 'to do' list. Writing down everything you need / want to get done and having a big list to look at can be incredibly overwhelming and may cause you to recede further into your illness and retreat. We don't want that. Pick the one thing you want to get done either the night before or that morning and just do it. 

2. Your basic responsibilities such as going to work and feeding your children / pets does not count. Most of us have already learned to go through the motions of doing these things without reaching out of our comfort zone. Pick something you would normally procrastinate on or not do at all. 

3. Do it every day no matter what. No matter how shitty you feel or how badly you want to stay in bed. Staying in bed and doing nothing only feeds into our sense of worthlessness and self hatred. Get your ass up and at least do the one thing, even if you go right back to bed afterwards. If you are having an extraordinarily bad day pick the easiest thing you can possibly think of to get done and do it. Even if it only takes 30 seconds.

4. Allow yourself forgiveness if you don't complete your task to the extent that you originally wanted to. Beating yourself up is counter productive to the point of the exercise. Quoted from one of our members that suggested this rule.
&gt;I've been doing this and it does help. I am also more forgiving of myself. If I did have something I wanted to do, but didn't get it done I tell myself: it's okay, at least you got x,y,z done, and next time you should try to do x,y,z better. Really really really helps. 

_____________________________________________________

Please feel free to share / discuss any other rules for this exercise that should be added.

And of course PLEASE share with us how / if it's working for you. Tell us the things you accomplished today and in the future. 

For me today I cleaned my critter cages and took one of them that is no longer in use out to my garage and vacuumed the room I keep them in.

___________________________________________________

TL:DR (though I urge you to read at least the basic rules of the exercise) Do one productive thing a day no matter what. It might help you feel a little less worthless and demotivated. ",5,ductive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless

I love her so fucking much. Throughout December, I was looking back at the past few months and couldn't believe how good my life has become, just because of that one person. 
Tonight, she just told me that she has changed. That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it. I haven't done anything, I've always been there for her, I did my best as a boyfriend. She didn't let me say anything, to try and change her mind. It ended so fast.
My whole life got destroyed tonight. She was my whole life. And I know I'm not getting her back. I love her so much and I don't know what to say. I've spent 2 hours just crying, thinking and listening to some music. I feel so empty, my heart just fucking hurts. I'm just thinking of ending it all. On top of that, I have other problems - my mother is sick and I have financial problems. She made it better. She gave me hope. I'm tired of it all. The pain, the tears and despair. I don't even understand anymore; HOW CAN IT GET BETTER? I don't see any possible scenario of my life getting better. I really wanted to share, and I have no one so close to me to really vent out. I only have Reddit.
Thank you so much if you read through this, it means so much. I'm broken right now. I don't know what's gonna happen to me or what I'll do.",4,"she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it"
"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way I‚Äôve been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship that‚Äôs been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldn‚Äôt beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isn‚Äôt perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didn‚Äôt sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I don‚Äôt have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and I‚Äôm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. It‚Äôs like my life is getting back together and I‚Äôm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if you‚Äôre in high school that school isn‚Äôt the devil you see it to be. 

I‚Äôm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities. Even when everything is at its worst there‚Äôs always something good in your life, even if it‚Äôs that you woke up today :) ",2,got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life. So yeah thats it, feel free to ask me any questions while I live the last 8 months of my life.",2,"My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner"

"Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :)

A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle...

"The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.

I went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.

The past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with ""feeling"" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.

We agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.

My appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.

I don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.

TL;DR: Can you give any tips as to handle talking to my doctor about all this? What do I say, what is important to mention?",3,"went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me"

"I used to lead a successful life and was proud of how simple and easy my life had turned into, and I believed that my purpose in life was to show everyone around me how to live successfully without disrespecting anyone or any rules and without cutting corners.  In essence I felt that I held the key to happiness and was eager to share it with anyone who was willing to follow my example.

Unfortunately, 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma, and was totally unprepared for that even though it was highly likely to happen during my lifetime.  At the beginning I was positive about the whole situation, so I went to a blind rehabilitation center thinking that after coming out I would pick up where I left and continue to be an example to others, but I totally underestimated the mental drag that comes with being blind.  I started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist shortly after going blind, and in 4 years I had 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists tel me that I show no signs of clinical depression beyond wanting to die, so I'm not taking any meds.

The problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag that makes everything extremely unpleasant to do, and I know that these problems aren't going away as there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can do to return my life to what it was.  I'm also no longer an example to anyone as I have become extremely dependent, not because I don't want to do things but rather because I refuse to accept that I'm blind and have to do them differently, so the only way I see out of this is killing myself, but even that becomes much harder to do blind.",3," 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma,problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag"

"Why is it that we often hold on to something that we shouldn‚Äôt. We were two women early 20‚Äôs dated for 5 years. Our relationship faced many ups and downs as any relationship does. There were times that were easily defined as toxic. Then why do I still deeply miss her, she still remains as the first and last thought of every day. We don‚Äôt speak, we don‚Äôt associate through social media, all contact has been cut.

Little back story, like I said we were in a lesbian relationship together. She so badly wanted to get married and although I was unsure I knew essentially she was the person I would love to spend the rest of my life with. As we went through the process of getting a ring everything fell into place it had been 2 years without almost any fights. Finally the big day came, I proposed.
She said yes! Only to break up with me for ‚Äúno reason‚Äù a week later. I was destroyed. She moved out nearly 3 months later and took her almost 5 months to admit she was sleeping with her male boss a week before I proposed.

I forgive her for these things that she must‚Äôve been too ashamed to admit. She made me believe I was crazy when I noticed late night texts from her boss. Literally convinced me I had imagined seeing his name pop up on her phone, I suppose to cover up the fact she was doing something not very nice to the person she was supposed to marry. All and all thinking I was literally going crazy drove me to deep contemplation of suicide several times.

There‚Äôs more details involved that are to say the least twisted and sick but I was so desperately trying to hold on to her that I didn‚Äôt think twice of her late nights 6 days of the week or helping her shave private places when she said she was hanging with friends..

When she left she told me it was easy for her to leave me just as she left her family for me. She came from a loving family unfortunately they were Jehovahs Witnesses so they disassociated with her immediately after finding out she had been dating a ‚Äúworldly‚Äù female. 

I know she‚Äôs damaged psychologically, and in my heart I just want to pick her up and help her through her problems. She won‚Äôt let me, and that‚Äôs okay. But why do I miss her so? Why is she in my daily thoughts and nightly dreams? It‚Äôs been a year and time will keep rolling, will I always miss this woman that wasn‚Äôt healthy for me or herself?

Thanks if you actually read this and to all it‚Äôs okay if you didn‚Äôt, simply feel a tad better getting these deep thoughts off of my chest.

"My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while.



Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more. He kept telling me how beautiful and gorgeous I am and eventually we had sex.

"Recently I received some bad news at home ‚Äî another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don‚Äôt want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my ‚Äúluck‚Äù is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the ‚Äúblack and white thinking‚Äù that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I‚Äôm thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment.

It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.

"I'm really bad at making friends, and worse at moving on when I mess up and lose one. My trust issues make it a lot harder to accept that certain people genuinely care for me.

A few months ago I had a really bad anxiety attack and said a lot of awful things to a friend who had been incredibly amazing and supportive. She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated. After several weeks, I tried to reconnect with some of them, but they definitely want nothing to do with me. I feel ashamed that I've let my depression get this far.

Even if they were to give me another chance, I'm not even sure how to be happy at this point. I know that I will unintentionally make them feel worse, manipulate, and push them away. I don't want to, but I become a really shitty person when I get close to people. In addition, I don't think I would feel any different. I think that I would still feel unwanted, even if that isn't how they feel or treat me. I don't know what to do. 

I don't want to be alone, but I also don't want to be a harmful presence to the people that I care about.

Everything is so convoluted at this point that I don't even know if I'm being honest or hiding parts.

I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. 

So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"".

I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.",4,"was dating a really great girl but she dumped me, were really close friends after we broke up, even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything, she didnt want to get back together, Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle"

"I created this account to seek advice as I would prefer to protect the privacy of my wife and her brother - don't mind the vast emptiness of my post history. If this is the wrong place to post this or if someone knows a better sub, please let me know and I will remove / x-post as needed.

I have tried to assist my brother-in-law over the course of three years in a multitude of ways but I am not sure if there will ever be anything that can truly be ""done"" for him - thus I am reaching out to see if anyone has a different take on it all. Obviously there will be big chuncks of information that will be omitted due to space / time / privacy / etc reasons but I'll try to express everything the best I can. My background is homeless youth (troubled home, graduated high school late, etc) and then military service for nearly a decade, 37 yrs old now.

My brother-in-law (Let's call him BIL or BILL for short) was under the care of a psychaiastrist from the age of 12 to 28 yrs old (when the doctor retired). This psychiastrist medicated Bill with Adderall and clonazepam under the diagnosis of depression and ADHD. When Bill talks to me about this doctor he readily admits that he thinks the relationship had crossed the line between doctor-patient and that the doctor probably prescribed whatever Bill wanted.

From what I have been told from Bill's mom, dad and siblings, and Bill himself, Bill was a smart kid but wasn't someone who had any particular interest (no chess team, choir, sports, etc) and was pretty anti-social. Bill started drinking around age 16 as he felt him fit in.

Bill graduated from his very religious school and upbringing on time. He went into a custodial position right after HS and went to college for a portion of a year but dropped out. From that point forward, Bill lived with girlfriends and could hold a  job for about a fifth of a year up until I met the family. I emplyed Bill for about a year where I found that he was a hard worker but he required (I mean literally) constant supervision and instruction. Bill is not an idiot. I want to be clear about this. Bill is obviously an intelligent man who has a lot of potentional. With that said, he doesn't seem to have the ability to link the multiple steps from the beginning of a problem to the conclusion of the fix. Think about if I asked you to install a toilet - most of us, if we did not know what to do, would look up a video or read the instructions that were included. Bill would instead plan a large and very complicated process that would end up consuming an entire day without Bill being able to really explain what he did all day and why the toilet wasn't installed. However, if I explained the process up front or told Bill to look up a video, the task would get completed well and with quality. Bill has been pretty blunt in our conversations in that he says he has never paid a single dollar towards any rent in his life.

Bill expresses deep depression often, self-harms (and tells me that it's only for attention) and will actively sabotage any efforts to assist him. A good example is that he will discuss the desire to move into a support house so he can be around others going through this. He will make appointments, will ask me for a ride (where I will take time off work) and then on the day of the appointment, will reschedule the event (key point here that I didn't say ""cancel the event"") and proceed to get smashed drunk. I only find out after I have driven an hour and a half to pick him up that he is passed out drunk on his mom's sofa.

So that is Bill in a nutshell.

Bill's mother was, by my defination, an enabler to the extreme. She acted completely dumbfounded each and everytime Bill is drunk / quits a job / gets arrested / etc. She will take even the most obvious lies he spins as facts. I had been around for when Bill would tell her, slurring words and stumbling, that he isn't drunk and she would believe him, chalking it up to ""Bill must be tired"". This continued all the way up until earlier this year when she realized that if she kept cleaning up after him, he would kill himself (driving drunk, alcohol poisioning, self harm that went wrong). We have paid for Bill to go through five rehabs over the last 3 years and used state rehabs twice as we no longer have the funds for private help. Bill's girlfriend finally got tired of everything and booted him out. He moved in with his mother until recently when the local PD had arrested Bill six times in two weeks for PIs and trespassing. At that point we took him to a state rehab in Fort Worth, Tx to try yet again.

Bill finished the rehab about a month ago, got drunk and is now living homeless in the FTW area. He keeps in touch regulary (I cover his phone expenses, provided him with cold weather gear, shelter info, and visit him weekly). He has been hospitalized twice for alcohol poisoning over teh last month but still refuses to follow-up on the resources that are offered to him. I was tehre for both ER stays (both turned into 3-4 day in-patient stays) where the nurses and doctors offered him help but he never showed up to any of the follow-up visits. Bill's entire family ahs told him many, many times that we are all here for him.

I care about Bill but the most painful part of all this (for me) is I see how much of a toll this takes on my wife. She is a recovering addict (4 years sober!) and she has an intimate understanding of the pain and physical harm that can evolve from Bill's situation. I have spent many nights going to NAR-Anon groups trying to learn to be as supportative as I can for my wife but with Bill, I honestly have no idea what else I have to offer. My wife has remained sober as she makes that choice every single morning to be sober.

I guess after writing all this I have a fairly simple question for a very complicated situation - Can someone tell me stories about what has helped others / themselves in the past that might have seen any of this?

I know there are some folks out there that can't be helped. Others still can be helped but only they can start the process. If we can't help Bill, what can I say to the family to help (as much as is possible in this situation)?

Thanks for anyone's time who reads this and thanks even more for anyone who has even the slightest advice for us to help Bill.

"don't worry i'm not going to do anything, just stating a fact. everyone who is alive contributes things to the world, and they take things from the world, and i contribute less and take more than a ""normal"" person.

the resources used to keep me going could be used on someone who wants to be alive, someone who is a net gain to their community or at least is not a burden, and yet you keep me going. why? 

i'd imagine if you look behind the veil, the reason is simple: losing me would hurt people who actually are a net gain to the world. people who are valuable in every respect, from the economy to socially. the shining stars that are the only reason i remain alive.

this is the true nature of suicide prevention. it isn't about me, i'm a lost cause... it's about not hurting people who actually matter. i know it shouldn't be this way but it just is, i know for a fact i'm not a worthwhile person, i've had it shoved in my face many times recently.

i'm a failure in every respect. if i were to die in an accident tomorrow, the world would be better off, even if nobody wants to admit it. and yet i keep on marching, for those that care about me, for those that would be deeply scarred by my loss... but never for myself. i don't deserve it.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I  have dead eyes. 
   
All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. 

This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago.

"So I guess this started when my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much. He is angry, mentally abusive, short tempered, and has started abusing alcohol like I have never seen him do before in the almost 30 years I've been around. His is still my dad' and I still love him' but it has been a tough couple months. I have drawn the longer of the sticks, because unlike my mother and my sister I don't live at home so I only see him a few times a week, when they have to deal with his abuse everyday. 

I do what I can to be a support for them, I've always been a person who could be strong for another person (especially my mom). She leans on me with all her problems (financial and mental) mostly dealing with her depression that stem back to losing her own mom. It doesn't bother me when she calls me sad because usually she just needs to vent and everything is ok. 

But now its different

One, it's not just my mom calling it's my sister also, who I have never had to worry about because she is a mentally strong person, but now I feel my dad is breaking her down and she isn't strong enough to deal with my dad and be the shoulder for my mom who is starting to spiral. Two, my mom will not seek help (even though she has in the past), and my sister mentioned she has been making suicidal comments (which I'm not sure if she did that when she first dealt with depression, I was pretty young and don't remember). 

We are a fairly poor family who has managed to get by, but it's not like we can afford a psychologist. Which is part of the reason I have taken the role of being the person everyone in the family vents to. 

So I guess what I'm asking the reddit community if anyone takes the time to read all this is....

1. Has anyone dealt with a stroke victim like this before and how did they handle it.
2. How do I keep my younger sister sane when she means so much to me, and I hate to see her fall into depression like my mom has in the past
3. How do I get my mom to seek whatever help is out there, and are there any freeish psychs out there that help people who are in a deep state of depression.
4. How do I try to stay strong when my entire family is falling apart and I feel so helpless and scared.

Sorry for the probably million misspellings, it's been a long day and I'm tired. 

Thanks to anybody who has been through something similiar and can possibly help. Part of this might just be I needed to vent, and had no one to turn to. Thanks to reddit, when you can't turn to anyone now you can turn to everyone.

P.S. if you are a depressed person seak help, it's not selfish, it's not just sadness, it's a disease. ",3,"my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much.

"SO I have struggled with clinical depression my entire life, and I see a psychaitrist/therapist, and I talk with my therapist and something I struggle with the most is I can be hard on myself/expect a lot of out myself, and always feel overwhelming guilty, or like a failure, or worthless, or disgusting when I don't do something right or make a mistake. And I don't know if what happened this time is one of those cases where I am being too hard on myself or if I should feel horrible and guilty.

So I also do drink with friends usually once a week or so (at a bar, friends house, or my place), but I know how dangerous it can be to drink with depression and sometimes I have gotten too drunk so I really try to be conscious and drink responsibly when I do. And last night I had like 5 friends over for a girl's night, and we all drank and had fun drunk talk until like 5am, and it was really great and fun and I think I drank just the right amount (enough to have a good time but not enough to go overboard), but at the very end of the night I guess I had one last drink too many because the last hour of the night is fuzzy (like I kind of remember the last hour but not fully)....and I didn't do anything bad or embarassing in regards to hanging out with my friends, but when I woke up (and this is what I feel disgusting and guilty about) I discovered I wet the bed!!! And i feel horrible and disgusting that I let myself drink that much again that I fucking wet the bed? like i feed so ashamed and horrible and gross and disgusting. and im so sad becase it was a really great and fun night otherwise but i feel like this ruins the entire memory too because i just feel so ashamed and guilty and disgusting. Like even being able to type this out was hard because I feel so horrible and ashamed. And I live with my husband and I made sure to clean it up so he wouldn't find out and not even tell him because I felt so ashamed (I ended up falling asleep on the guest bed in a different room than him where me and my friends were hanging out)

I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life.

I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself.

I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically.

So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.

Ever since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.

We were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my ""me time"" that I relished in before the relationship became ""us time"" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.

We traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new ""friendship"" with a guy she worked with.

Fast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.

My self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.

The result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no ""good days"" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.

All I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.

I feel I am unwell and I do not know what to do.

Sorry for the long post.",4,"since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness"
"Hello. First of all, i apologize about my English. I'm 17yo and I do not usually speak english. I'll do my best for sure.
I'll present myself shortly : 
I'm a 17yo white boy in Western Europe, 1m85 tall. Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )
So, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl. We met each other two and a half month ago. This night, I was crying so badly because of my ex when she came to me and gave me a hug. She took care of myself, she heard me, she told me her own story, and then we slept together. Since this night, we have been dating each other. 
She has been so nice with me all this time long.
Two months later, i'm feeling as if i'm not deserving her. By induction, i'm feeling as if i wouldn't ever been able to be happy with anyone due to my low self esteem. ( That was already a problem during my last love-relationship. )
I've already use to struggle with depression, but what panics me is that i'm in graduating class and I have to succed it if i wan't to have a nice CPGE ( preparatory classes to prestigious universities ) and thus i would more likely get a well ranked university. 
I'm feeling lost. I don't have any idea about what i should do, if I should leave her asap to flee my own problems, if finally works shouldn't have the priority for once and i should focus about myself, or if i'm not seeing the most important here...
Thanks to you if you read me, that was pretty difficult for me to write ""non-academicly"" in English. If i did loud ( or even slight, but it should contains a lot and i wouldn't take up too much of your time ) mistakes, i would be glad to learn and improve my English, by the way. Have a nice day or a nice evening. It's 4a.m. for me while i'm writing this. ",4,my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me

"I feel like most of us are leaning way more toward the emotional than the stoic. And as a male I have been trained to not be emotional, and also there really isn't a support system in place. Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of ""maning up"", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im ""stable"" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. 

How can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. 

Also, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to? I just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden to be placed on a SO (which i scare away due to said mistake). I love the few friends i have but they in no way can offer that kind of support. ",4,just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden
"Long post coming ft. an overreaction of the year. Just had to vent this somewhere, wasn't going away.

So I just rece a message from someone. I had asked them to play, and they replied back with ''no hi or hello?''. It's just another one of the things I forget. Basic social rules like saying hi. Maybe it's the case that I've always been a cold and clumsy person, but I was forgiven for it when younger because of still being outgoing and trying to be positive around others. Now I can barely tell what I do wrong anymore, it just seems to be everything in so many parts of life. I'm an idiot. I've tried to be more caring but still feel so disconnected and unappreciated by others. It's not like being appreciated is what I'm entitled to. It's the contrary, and on the bright side maybe that could have its benefits too. You won't get any unwanted attention if you don't want to, you can just keep to yourself and people will respect that.

What makes me feel worse is that despite trying to connect others, I can't seem to. There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong. Accidentally offending someone, not asking interesting enough questions, sounding lazy. Even if I change to seem more positive or confident (though no one has even pointed out that I seem negative!) it doesn't seem to make any difference. People react weirdly to me anyways. I feel like I can't even have small talk without it being noticed how awkward I am, how no one really gives a fuck, how my mind is blank and I have nothing fun to talk about. I feel like I've been contaminated and can't do anything right despite my best efforts. Almost never share negative feelings  with people either, so that's not the issue despite what this pity post might let someone think.

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********.

I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode.

For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

I don't do well with accountability for myself. Like when I work with a team or have to lead a team it gives me purpose. Without purpose it's just a matter of time when I fuck things up.

I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need.

I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either.

Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery.

What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse?

It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them.

I don't know the point of this post. 
But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. 

I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever.

"Back in October I lost my job. I was a temp at a college and my boss didn‚Äôt know there was a limit on the length of a temp contract. The thing is, she had been doing kind of shitty things and when I finally held firm on my personal boundaries- boom. Come to work, worked for 2 hours, told to pack up. I kept my cool, but when I asked if I could use my boss as a reference she said ‚Äúwe can talk about that later.‚Äù I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist since the day I stood up for myself, just before they let me go though. The therapist is great and I understand that my old boss was manipulative, unfair, and just a shitty person. Still, as the sole breadwinner for my husband and kids I felt like I had been punched in the gut and the feeling hasn‚Äôt really gone away yet. 

My husband is going back to school and also takes care of our 2 girls ages 2.5 and 5 years. He is getting better at being supportive but is pretty much the most unemotional person I‚Äôve ever met. He doesn‚Äôt understand that my depression is not a choice. Why on earth would anyone want to feel this way? My psychiatrist and therapist keep emphasizing that I practice self care and give myself space but whenever I ask if I can just be alone for a bit, or go out with friends, my husband acts resentful. 

In late November I started a new temporary position whoch should go through March, and all I do is go to work, come home to a crazy house (we also live with my loud, dumb, &amp; chatty af mother-in-law) and then go to bed when the kids finally concede. I feel fine at work, almost good sometimes, but as soon as I come home I feel totally overwhelmed. I have few escapes and I find myself wishing I could disappear from the world and that my family would magically forget me so that they wouldn‚Äôt be hurt and I wouldn‚Äôt scar my kids for life. 

Tonight I brought up taking a class I really want to take two nights a week, which would mean I wouldn‚Äôt get home until after the kids are asleep, and one of those nights my MIL or my parents would need to watch the girls for a few hours. My husband‚Äôs reaction was basically through gritted teeth ‚Äúit would make a lot of things unnecessarily hard, but if you feel like it‚Äôs what you need to do...‚Äù

So the words were ok, but the way they were said changed the message entirely. Like I said, he doesn‚Äôt have/process emotions well so I‚Äôm trying to tell myself that he just isn‚Äôt aware that his resentment seeps into things all the time and ruins them. Straightforward- ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too much,‚Äù compromising- ‚Äú how can we work around the schedule conflict?‚Äù Or ACTUAL support- ‚ÄúI know you need to something for yourself.‚Äù Would all be fine, but saying something vaguely supportive with a hostile attitude feels manipulative. I keep wishing I could just go to my mom‚Äôs house for the first time in my adult life because there even though my parents are weird they also can just be straightforward or supportive without emotional strings.

So tonight I went into my space-out mode after the class conversation, which then turned to silent sobbing. Couldn‚Äôt read to my kids because I was crying and they couldn‚Äôt understand me, couldn‚Äôt do anything. Husband just sat around with me and the kids, never asked if I needed something, or wanted to be alone for a bit. No acknowledgement whatsoever about the fact that for over an hour I sobbed while it upset my kids. The lack of response is almost worse than the conflicted responses, but both leave me feeling utterly alone and wanting to die. There. I fucking said it.

So here I am. On Reddit. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone actually reading this, and the truth is what difference would it make? If you are reading this, thank you. I hope that you are coping with your challenges better than I am, and that you have someone who can support you in the ways you need.

"Hey People of Reddit,

I don't know if Im actually depressed, but I may be depressed at times and I feel like I could do so much with life but I can't.


Quick list of my issues :
First off the weed/hash issue.
Im addicted to this shit. I don't do it socially I do it at home at my computer mostly because im a big computer tech geek person. I get high and enjoy my time alone just doing nothing but shit..the thc makes nothing great. 
weed is my biggest life killer...I skipped high school so much in my life and had crazy allergies and always felt sick so I kind of fucked up my education only to realise in my mid 20s that Im allergic to weed and it makes me have a runny nose the next day and itchy eyes and I have asthma so I breath badly when i smoke a lot in the next couple days and get bloated and just feel so shitty.. so that fucked with my education..im 28 now. I think it fucked my social life too and Iv know this for a couple years and I don't wanna smoke but i just cant stop I hate myself its a real addiction. It makes me not wanna hang with people or go in public due to paranoid thoughts. It fucks up my motivation and ambition and i just work in a call center ( which im a top seller at ) but its such a low income and low ambition job.

I don't have many friends and I honestly hate a lot of people , in my experience I don't meet or attract cool people at all. 

I have a gf and shes so cool and so like me..shes a little bit of a problem drinker and weve been together for 3 years and have had our ups and downs. 

Im a 5'11 wide guy with muscles..I should weigh 200 but i weigh 250 and its a drag and im self conscious about my tummy even if it isnt huge but its still a fat tummy. I have issues with my knees and back ( ashritis since im 15 and medication doesnt really help much anymore ).

I used to play hockey a lot and with the boys we would go out and shit it was a good way of having friends who are men in my life but since the past 3 years iv torn my groin ( sports hernia ) twice which will have you not doing sports for about a year every time you tear it. Hockey was my life and its fucking gone and I feel like it will tear again.

On top of that i sweat a lot...even when i was 210 lbs I was sweating a lot..mostly my back and my head so my hair gets drenched walking a couple blocks and then my back sweats and it drips down into my boxers and i just gotta wear black cloths or if i sit on my ass theyll be a sweat stain.. its a huge thing in my life and it affects me very much in a lot of situations, lets just say im the only guy at work with a fan and I overheat very easily a lot..even in -20 weather if i walk like 3 blocks ill get home sweaty and im just always like wtf...imagine in +20 weather how bad it can be..I wear the same shirt and cloths almost everyday that dry up quick and are dark colors...

My gf is great she doesnt mind the sweat she is a special girl, im surprised i even have a gf like wtf. altho she has issues similiar to me i can understand how we are in eachothers life still...having a girl in ur life can be great and can also be the shittiest thing ever but once you go there you never can go back to being single.

I don't know im just looking for words of wisdom and advice maybe,..I know i don't have it as bad as some people here.. I have a good family but i avoid them...i don't rly like my dad but hes in my life and my parents divorced when i was 1 year old I think...he cheated on her and tried to fuck with her during my childhood and all kinds of fucked up shit...

Im def stuck in my comfort bubble. All I wanna do is either become an actor ( fuck theyll stop the scene and be like can you not sweat sir during the scene ) or become a rapper/sound designer but that shit involves connecting with people who just never seem interested and everyone wants to do their own thing nowadays and I feel i need a mentor for this so its hard.

I could go on and I feel i can't even explain the real issues in my life in this post.

Any advice/words of wisdom?

"3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. 

Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness.

I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago.

Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. 

Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. 

She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously.

What's the point in living life if everything causes you pain? What did I do to deserve this? I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?!

"I was sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years when out of nowhere there was this flash of memory, and I remembered that this isn't the first time things have been bad, and that things have actually been far, far worse. And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great.

"I got out of the psych ward after a two week stay just a few days ago. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, but I don't know how accurate the diagnosis could be given that I have the tendency to act accordingly to avoid certain diagnosis. My mother keeps trying to label me as a psychopath or sociopath, or a borderline. Mainly because I don't love her, I don't necessarily care about her or my brother. I think about them dying a lot, but I wouldn't kill them or anyone. I just know that I wouldn't particularly be upset if it happened, and that goes for most other members of my family.
I do have feelings for a few of my friends and partners, boyfriends or friends with benefits but I can't picture losing them like I can my parents. Maybe I'm too self absorbed but I really don't know.
My IQ is 108 so I don't think I could be a sociopath given that they usually are much smarter than the average person. A psychopath I don't know either but I really don't want to diagnose myself with anything, I'd hate to label myself as that kind of person.
I used to be a Christian. I was reading an old journal a few days ago, from eighth and ninth grade. I had written out a prayer, angrily question God as to why he allowed me to be born without the capacity to love my family.
I've never been suicidal, or tried to hurt myself past a certain extent. It seems like every emotion I do have is stronger to me than it would be the average person, I don't know why. It's hard for me to empathize with most people.
Based on experience or general knowledge from a third party, what are the possibilities that my mother is right about me? Is this regular teenage angst? I'm nearly seventeen.

"Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.
But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. 
My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.",5,"thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future.

"For years I had been telling myself that I would never be smart enough to get a scholarship, I would never go to university, I believed I would never succeed academically. 

Today I got a letter from the university I applied to, they not only accepted my application but offered me a $12,000 scholarship. I should be happy, more then that, ecstatic. This is the goal I have been trying to accomplish for years, the goal I never believed I would accomplish.

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.

"I sometimes wish the world would end. Still here, I am awake, haunted by the sound of a subtle whisper.

Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news.
Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice....

Well 2 weeks In thoughts started occurring  to me, what if I get fired? What if I fail my classes? What if I loose my friends? Now I want to make it clear, I've had  depression and anxiety  for about 4 years and it hasn't gotten any easier hell it's the reason my last realtonship  ended in flames. Anyway so I tried not to succumb to the pressure  and bad thoughts that comes with anxiety  and depression so I started to try as hard as I could and even still I started to fail my classes so I thought well fuck how am I supposed to deal with this and the same day someone I thought I could count on decided she didn't want to be friends anymore so instead of coming and talking  to me like an adult she decided to call the cops and wrongfully  accuse  me  of stalking and tried to have me arrested long story short I ended up having to spend a night in holding. So I lost a friend and to make a long story short my whole world is crumbling right in front of me, I left school, I don't have a job and I think one of my best friends I think doesn't want to be friends  anymore and you know what I don't blame her, and just for now we will call her, M and truth be told I've kinda developed feelings for,  M as much as I like to deny that it's the truth, this might not even be in the same category but I'm also an extremely violent person I got it under control in the past few years but that doesn't stop the thoughts hurting someone else as a kid once I stabbed  another kid in the arm with scissors, even my other friends, I'll name them A, and J,  I think of hurting, I honestly  don't know what to do. I almost killed myself I had the knife pressed up against  my stomach and if the RA didn't come in I probably  would have done  it, and honestly  I'm thinking about doing it again.

"I don't know where else I can go to talk about all of this, so here goes I guess. I'm a 19 year old male and I feel like my life is already over. My dad refuses to apologize for running out on us when I was 3 years old; my mother says he only picked me up twice from the time I was born until I could walk. 

My first memory is of my older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came. I was 3 at the time, and they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom while she was deployed overseas and spent weeks at a Motel 6 across town, leaving us to fend for ourselves, and we would have starved had my oldest sister not called the school and gotten one of her teachers to come give us groceries to hide from him. We were afraid to call the police because he might come back and beat us or worse. We were just kids, I don't know what else we could have done and it's in the past now so who cares. 

The few times he did come back, he would take away the groceries we had and take all the money in my sister's piggy bank. 
Over the past decade my siblings and I have rolled through the years binging on drugs, buying from the internet and selling them to get my next high. My nephew was taken by CPS when my sister almost died from a week-long binge on meth. 

My stepfather is an idiot but means well, and he's about the best I could ask for in a time like this, but as much as I try, I can't fill the void my dad left. He tries to talk to me now, but refuses to apologize or even acknowledge the terrible things he did. I don't think I can ever forgive him, and I don't know what to do.
I don't want to go back to the drugs, but it would be so easy to run down to the supermarket and get a bottle of cough syrup for under 5 bucks to make me feel a little numb for a few hours. 

I tried to kill myself a month ago and spent 3 days in a psych ward which helped only in the way that I would do anything to get out of there, even lying about my mental state in order to get discharged as soon as possible. I've been prescriped antidepressants and xanax and i have a solid couple of best friends that I'm closer to than anyone in my family, but they're going back to college at the end of this winter break and I'll be stuck in my shitty hometown with no prospects for the future.
I worked as an EMT for a few months after getting my certification about a year ago, but I saw some shit that still haunts me every night.

I don't know what to do, where to turn, or who can help me.

My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.

My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

"Hello all. This is my first post in this sub, and this actually is probably my first serious post on all of Reddit. I‚Äôm just here because I would like to get some things off my chest and I‚Äôm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends. It‚Äôs best to say these things to people I don‚Äôt know but may also suffer from the same feelings or ideas.

I am severely and unhealthily depressed. I stress myself out over little things, I constantly put myself down, blame myself for things that I damn well know are not actually my fault, treat myself horribly and find different ways to make my life even worse daily. I don‚Äôt like being this way, but I have tried so many different methods to change these kinds of behaviors and feelings but nothing I have done makes me change. I‚Äôve tried antidepressants, ‚Äúnatural alternatives‚Äù to medicine, exercising my stress away, surrounding myself with positive thoughts and energy and people, but for some reason, every night when I return home and get in the bed, I lie awake thinking of how worthless and pointless my existence is. I am absolutely SHOWERED by thoughts of depression and worthlessness, despite knowing how many good friends and family I have, despite knowing how good my life has the potential to be. Every day feels almost like a struggle to me because I spend a good portion of the day out and about with friends or at work, or whatever I‚Äôm doing, but as soon as I get by myself somewhere, I almost immediately start to get those depressive thoughts again and again.

It almost seems like my brain refuses to let the rest of me be happy. I try to push away the bad thoughts and sadness but it just keeps coming back even stronger every time and I have gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt know how to handle myself anymore. I have suicidal thoughts daily, although I would never act upon them because I know that suicide is not the only answer to my issues. But it‚Äôs just an every day thought that I have, that I struggle with constantly. Always telling myself, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a failure anyway, why not just do it‚Äù or things like ‚ÄúYou know your family or anybody wouldn‚Äôt ACTUALLY miss you, right?‚Äù It‚Äôs just little things like those that add up ever so much throughout the days, weeks, and months that I struggle with. Sometimes I will have days that are absolutely fantastic like going to a concert or being in a show or whatever, and then as soon as I get home, I feel like garbage for whatever reason. No matter how many positive thoughts I try to think, the bad thoughts always find a way to become stronger and break through my positivity. And I‚Äôm just not sure what to do about it anymore.

Apologies for writing so much, but as I said before, these were things that I was keeping bottled up because I could not tell my family or friends about this because of reasons I‚Äôm not actually sure of. Fear that I will be judged, maybe fear of losing friendships, I don‚Äôt know.

This is so not me! I‚Äôm not a crier! I‚Äôm someone strong who can fucking do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. I‚Äôm so sick of feeling weak and vulnerable. This is not who I am.

And then when I went to acupuncture today. Again. Totally fine, toddling through life, walk into the acupuncturist‚Äôs office, he asks me how I‚Äôm going, and ... bam. Tears. 

I don‚Äôt mind crying when there‚Äôs a cause. And to be honest, I actually don‚Äôt usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isn‚Äôt a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic.

I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I don‚Äôt, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, there‚Äôs a greater chance that I won‚Äôt - I wouldn‚Äôt, anyway - but ... it‚Äôd be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But it‚Äôd just stop everything for me. 

All I could think was life would be easier if I was a crow.

They talk about the big dreams they have, and the fact that they picture a world where these dreams come true helps them get through today.

I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen.

I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen. I can't see myself ever opening up about any of this in person.

"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

I am just done with it all. I just can't take anymore and am ending it tonight.

"I've had the ""there's so much for you to live for"" talk too many times. Everyone's advice is all the same. It's all so trivial.

Eat healthy and exercise! I did. I started at 240 lbs. Got down to 180. Then I went on meds and went back to 220. 

Talk to people! I did. Now they don't talk to me or they're weird around me.

Get professional help! I did. They either didn't know what to do or they told me to go talk to someone else in my government's healthcare.

Take time for yourself! Ok I'm staring at a wall and my thoughts are racing now what?

Journal! Tried that, ended up with me just bitching about my problems to myself. Wasn't very helpful

Focus on your hobbies! Hard to do that when nothing interests me anymore.

Make goals and follow through! Ok I did them now what?

Take medication! I did. For almost a year. All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight.

Also great to hear that depression never really goes away it just gets easier to manage. What's the point? Living life for the sake of living just seems pointless to me.

Sometimes i would rather not exist or atleast, have a purpose a drive to live, for i always feel numb, there are brief moments were i can have good times but it takes all my being to maintiain. 

I sit here  wondering if there will be any true enjoyment in life, from what im surrounded by the drivel of normal life, is that what my fate is? a life of mundane bullshit of pointless relationships of sitting around doing nothing at all and even when something good comes along eventually it leaves that is the duality of life misery and happiness both ever flowing rivers which is not a bad thing, if it were not  for the fact that the ""good times"" seem to feel empty still  in the end there is still no reason no purpose we exist just waiting for the day we die.

In all things i thought had meaning, things that i thought i had pleasure in doing feel more and more empty to the point where i dont think i truly enjoy anything. So where does that leave me with no purpose no enjoyment just the goings of noraml life that is what i have to look foward to? in a sense that is hell, i can enjoy it for a while but not much longer than a month for i cannot exist just to enjoy life and have fun or some bullshit about finding love, pfff  that crap never lasts most of us fear loneliness, that is why we marry or spend long times with one person but eventually you will get tired of that person or they will lose their interest.

I have no idea why i feel the way i do, as if im completely blank that the idea of continuing this drives me insane i could not endure this. In the end i still do not understand how i feel im lost utterly searching for reason, but i doubt i will find it in this existence.

"Hi guys,
Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous.

Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.
In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..)

I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business.

"My daughter tried to kill herself, again. This is the third attempt that I know of. Her husband walked into the bathroom as she was digging into her arm. He said he has never seen anything like it. He is traumatized. After discovering that she had been self medicating with drugs and then this he is done. He is scared that her poor choices will land him in military prison. I love my daughter and this young man and I am saddened for both of them. I am sad for my daughter, I am not sure she will survive this break up. I am truly afraid that I will be burying my daughter.

My daughter has a mental illness. She has been diagnosed as bipolar and clinically depressed. This has been a struggle since she was a young teenager. We have lost friendships and family ties because of her poor choices, the lies, and lack of impulse control. She has stolen medication from me and others. She revealed, in a most spectacular fashion, that she was a drug addict when she was a teenager, all in front of a class that we were taking together. Needless to say I gave myself permission to have distance from my daughter. She was an adult. I had gotten her help, I had fought with her about staying on medications and going to doctors appointments. As an adult I could no longer force her to do what needed to be done, it was now up to her. 

She seemed to figure it out. She had a job, a bf, a home, and friends. I could see that she struggled with the rollercoaster that came with her diagnosis, but she was making it. Couple years in things toppled. Suddenly her friends and bf were done with, she had burned bridges with them. She was floating with no anchor or refuge. Except me and my partner. We were moving and offered her the opportunity to start fresh in another state. She leaped at the opportunity. But she first wanted to visit with my sister in yet another state. The agreement was that she would join us in the new place after spending time with my sister.

This turned into her living there until she burned bridges there. She became homeless. Too prideful to tell me that she was reduced to living in a homeless camp. All because she was now taking drugs to self medicate and she knew this would horrify me. She kept a job. She met the young man who would help get her clean, and marry her. He joined the military, they got stationed state side. Her husband and I continually prompted her to get medication and help. She put it off. She was on a high with life. Then the cycle began again.

She started using meth about 6 months ago. She snorted cocaine. She smoked weed. She planted this stuff in another persons car so that they couldn't turn her in. She was making illogical choices based on the drugs and her ill mind. My SIL left her to figure out what to do. Her actions could land him in Leavenworth, ruin his career. 

He came home and found what she had done. He got help for her. She calls me to tell me in her most piteous voice. Tries to tell me that he wouldn't listen to her, that she was getting rid of his monster of a wife. No amount of explaining and questioning would get her to see that these were her choices. As I write this, she is hospitalized. She knows that he wants a divorce, but she wants to fight for him. No convincing her that this is what needs to happen right now. He doesn't trust her, he is angry, and tired. I don't think he wants to continue and I can not blame him.

So where does this leave my broken daughter? I don't know. I am in another state. I am not where she wants to be. I fear that once she is released and she sees that he is done and he removes her from base it will be the beginning of the end. I have told her she needs to figure out what she wants. I feel she will choose drugs and all that comes with it. While I want so much more for her, I can't make her choose the path of health and sanity. I am heartbroken.",4," daughter has mental illness, tried to kill herself, diagnosed with bipolar disoreder , lost family ties and friendship"
"I **need** this year to be better.

I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing.

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself.

But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. 

I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. 

My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",2,"I failed two courses last semester, if I donít graduate they will cut financial assistance"

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically.

"I hate to be negative but I am just super tired. I've been pretending to be okay, happy, normal since I was 12. I've had breakdowns but it was easy to pretend I was okay and I could get through them because I was in middle or high school. 

I had my biggest breakdown in my life ever in January. And nothing has changed. I still feel the same. It's been 12 months and I'm just even more tired. I don't even feel anything anymore besides the occasional crippling sadness/loneliness. I binge and I don't feel anything anymore. I buy things and I don't feel anything anymore. I've been struggling and working so hard to change and nothing has changed. I honestly can't keep living like this, and I can't keep living if I will never be happy. I don't know how to be happy.

"I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad?

 I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. 

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this

"This has not been a good year for me, and has not been for a great amount of people, there is a great stigma towards 2016 as being a shitty year, but how many people actually lost something this year? 

Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads.

I'm tired of being told my depression is chemical inbalance or some other bs, I love life, but I'm tired of being pointed as the culprit because for sure I'm trying, how many times I messaged facebook ""friends"" and they were downer as fuck, only replying with fillers or excuses, nobody wants to hang out, most people don't want to really connect anymore, they want to live out their digital identities in real life, real socialization is basically dead, everyone is racing towards who's got the ""better"" social condition, who's got more likes? who's got more photos? I'm not exaggerating, instead of a simple gathering, hanging out, doing fun stuff, chat about life, everyone now hangs out to chat about other people, chat about material crap, chat about bs, chat about how they got fucked x amount of girls, or how they achieved y stuff, really fuck off with this crap, everyone likes to conversate about mundane crap, people don't want to exchange ideias, they wanna show off.",5,"Tired of being told Depression is chemical imbalance, nobody wants to hang out, people donít want to connect, real socialization is dead"
"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class.


i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting.


Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up.


So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole.


People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore.


Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.
I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically.


I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated.

"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression. She has been turning to alcohol to escape her feelings and I am not a dad or therapist and have no idea how to help her before she hurts herself or gets worse *without* seeming like a hypocrite because I do the same damn shit.",4,"My ex, still care about her ,still  care about her,thrown me into the hole again"
"1. ""You just have to wait for the right time. Stop trying. You're still young. You'll find the right person eventually."" 
This is literally just you pushing the problem off onto whoever I'm with the next time I'm having a bad day. And not everyone does fall in love. I find it more likely I'll be dead before that ever happens.

2. ""You have to love yourself before anyone else will love you.""
Then I guess I'm fucked. I don't love me. I despise me. So does everyone else. That's why I'm here.

3. ""Being in a relationship won't fix your depression.""
No shit. But you know what, I'm pretty sure having someone around who tells me they love me and hugs me when I'm sad sure wouldn't make things any worse.

4. ""You just gotta get out there and meet more people.""
Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it. The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly.

I'm sure there are others that I have grown tired of hearing, but I can't think of them at the moment. Basically, does anyone have any actually helpful advice for someone who is struggling with finding love?",5,"I donít love me, I despise me, so does everyone, having someone around who tells me they love me wouldnít make things worst"
"It seems like my 15-mid 20's I've had depression, I'm 25.

And these last few months hit me hard: I love to learn, I love learning about the world, the universe, programming in C++, etc. But reading philosophy made matters worse, I couldn't even get into discussions like free will or determinism, or simple politics; even worse if nihilism, existentialism, the existence of God, the soul, quantum mechanics, etc. were involved.

I noticed I had problem. I kinda just realized that nobody knows what's going on. Those questions, the big whys and hows are somehow preventing me from carrying on with my life. I was upset because it feels like there were no answers to those things. I still can't think straight, I get very emotional sometimes, crying in secret (I know, I should tell others). I think it has to do with my childhood: My mother is a hoarder, my father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, and they sometimes threatened to harm each other with knives and guns, my father went on long trips away, sometimes the police were involved. My mother would beat me and my brother, with belts or brooms (or la fabulosa chancla), sometimes for doing bad things... that's how they (and us, by proxy) were raised. But my sister and younger brother, haven't been hit once after I was 15. I know they wanted better for me and my siblings, deep down. And I don't want my siblings to feel any similar things, but they still live with my mother in a house full of junk. I want to help my parents, they're divorced now, but I want to help them. Has anyone gone through something similar? Is there anyway to help?

So anyways, back to this 2017. I'm gonna start meditation, connect with my family and long-time girlfriend, focus on studying, maybe start a local rock band with friends. How about you guys? What are you guys planning?

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"Well, fuck you! To be alone in the crowds better than to be alone (to be left, to not try for the other, but not to choose loneliness), to be better than to be with people who do not understand you; as if it had to be with those people. If they do not understand you, then go, go the fuck away, come along, be like me. What is holding you? I tell you what it is that scares you; to live my lonely life in the pile of meat surrounding you. It 's not hard to be alone, believe me, you just need to be yourself. It is very insincere when you stay in that crowd and whine about staying in that crowd and praise my loneliness. Fuck you one more time.

I am not sincere too. Sometimes I wanna get in between that rotten, stinky pile of meat you've stayed in between and feel safe. I can not live loneliness properly. 

To be alone is like a suicidal person stays between death and life. Those who dreaming death, those who see death as salvation, those who want to die think about that because their hope is fading. But the hope that has been left in his pocket allows him to continue for a while. There are also similar hopes in the people that alone. The lonely people waits for someone, wants to find someone. As long as you remain alone you will lose hope, knowing someone, having the ability to communicate with someone. The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.

The only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there. The ability to survive. It has not been too long.

sorry for my english. it is not my first language and i've learned it myself, so it's not good, bad actually... whatever, i hope you'll understand what i meant.

"*wave*

I'm unsure where to even begin..

It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist..

I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. 

I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all.

On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem.

I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence.

Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness.

People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all.

Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss..

I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly..

Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged.

Thanks for reading.",4,"I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. "

"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

This is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",1,"I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-,the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me"

(M/24/Appalachia)
Been depressed for over a decade now, and every year it's gotten worse. I feel like I am the subject of some cruel joke, a demented Truman Show, just tortured constantly in every aspect of life. Even the simplest tasks that people do, I have problems with. 



I am quite ill and have severe chronic pain (FAPs), but I can't get help because I live in the south and only junkies are allowed pain medicine here now with the new laws, and plus ""I'm too young to be so sick!"". I'm also a student but every year I fail half of my classes due to my illness or my severe crippling anxiety. The exhaustion is constant, and I don't have the mental or physical energy to do anything. I can't work either due to the same issues so I have no income, don't even have a bank account because I can't afford it. What money I do get I spend on cannabis for pain relief and so that I can keep food down (FGID). The pain really is crippling and I'm in tears from it 3+ times a day. I've waited 9 hrs in the ER, and I was still not seen by a doc. That's ""coal country"" for you, raped by corporations and then left to rot (//soapboxing)



I sleep about 3 or 4 nights out of the week (~4 hrs nightly), and have gone 6 days without sleep. Right now I'm on day 2. The sleep is never restful, I wake up about once an hour, the extreme pain creates these violent dreams where I am constantly getting brutally murdered. Takes me at least 3 hours to fall asleep, and I've spent 12+ hours laying awake in bed trying to sleep (I think that's why my joints hurt so bad.)



My psych is useless, he literally won't let me finish a single sentence and constantly berates me. He also refuses to treat me unless I take Paxil (his biggest sponsor) which previously led me to a suicide attempt and almost got me expelled from school (they thought I was on hard drugs). My psych didn't even have record of this suicide attempt even though I told them about it immediately. I've tried all the SSRI's and SNRI's and they all leave me worse than when I came in. I want to keep living and I'm afraid these meds will ensure that I don't. Sadly I can't switch doc's because the state pharmacy board will say I'm Dr. Shopping, being in WV they take it seriously. All of this together makes life like Chinese water torture. Drop by drop, day by day.



That's not even the worst of it, but I'll keep that one to myself for now or else some of you may think suicide *IS* a valid option for me! This event really gives me symptoms of PTSD though, but I don't self diagnose, and it puts a heavy load of regret on me I carry every day. Another deep regret I carry is from this: My good friend left from my house to a planned fight, which ended in my good friend using self defense and shot one of the men who was attacking. My friend just got 10 years for it, and I have so much weight on my heart that if I could have just stopped my friend from leaving he would still be free and this victim would still be alive. I think about it everyday. It really is torture in this poor tiny mountain town. This is as close to a 3rd world country in the US as it gets.

 

Socially I'm just as bad, heavily introverted. College is hell, I go to a small local campus of a bigger uni, meaning the class size is small. Forced participation is a nightmare, and there are no worse words to me than: ""Ok everyone, find a partner"" I end up alone every time. My every cough, every lead pencil broken, every sniff of the nose sends a wave a pure cringe through my body, even though I know it doesn't matter and no one cares. My anxiety gets so bad I have to leave class to puke, yet my psych sees no issues there. I find my self tailing friends at bars and if they leave I'm quietly in the corner awaiting their return. Comedy is my only crutch because physically I'm monstrous and have no self-esteem or confidence, I literally look like I have 2 black eyes ALL THE TIME. Tried all the creams and stuff but it's beyond help I think.



I don't expect anyone to have some magic solution but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. I don't remember what it's like to be happy, and I'm forgetting what it's like to be human as well. Thanks for listening it really means the world to me.



Positives: I have an apartment w/ no rent, I'm good enough comedian to have a YT channel. Play guitar fairly well. Compassionate and empathetic to the point where it screws me over. Great w/ kids (studying Elementry Ed., no anxiety towards the kids, but if an adult is there too the anxiey is through the roof) I also don't really get social anxiety when streaming on Twitch (unless I've had a little too much ganja) perhaps the the screen being a barrier that blocks some of the anxiety, who knows.


Sorry for the novel, that's adderall for ya.

"Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.

What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.

I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.

I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.

Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.

I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.

The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice hair and all that. My height ended up average, close to 6 feet, even though my paediatrician has always said I'd turn out 5'5-6 at best. I am bit underweight and have problems putting on weight (thyroid again?), but that's probably the only issue with my appearance. I was surprised to discover that my voice is kinda whiny a few years ago, but I don't think it's that bad.

And yet I feel like I repulse people. I've never had a girlfriend. Those few girls I liked never... really paid attention to me, even though I was nice to them and they were nice to me... I should've probably been more assertive but I've always feared the embarassment of bad social experience. I've pretty much stopped trying over the years. Also, I don't remember any girl ever trying to get me and if any did, I remain completely blind to it to this day. As I said, I've eventually become friends with most people around me but those relationships were always pretty shallow. I've had maybe two really good friends over the last 10 years (mind you, hardly the ""best friend"" category) but even they have been gradually drifting out of my life. I can't really fault them for that as they have their own exciting lives and I have almost nothing to offer in exchange for friendship... they've certainly tried to get me out of my shell (and still do from time to time) and I will remain grateful for that.

Last summer I got a work in a warehouse. Just wanted to make some quick buck and I think manual job suits me because my mind can shut off and go to its own place without any consequences. I did the job well, all eager and active and got on a good raport with some co-workers. And yet after a few weeks they started telling me that there were no hours avaiable for me even though they told me there would be hours for several months when they hired me. Hell, they even hired more people after me and those were still coming to work. I've checked in a few more times after that and all I got were weird faces and evasive answers so I stopped. To this day I don't know what I did wrong. It's a small episode but it's pretty indicative of the rest of my life... I don't know what I did wrong and yet people never really connected with me on a deeper level so I drifted away from them as they did from me.

I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years. It's a real wonder that nobody ever got hurt. My mom's got anxiety and a phobia from dirt and diseases so she gets panic attacks basically all the time. It took my dad years to become mindful of that and the relationship has gone really sour over that time. Today they just fight over everything, even the smallest, stupidiest things, like who is going to cook a dinner. That has probably affected me too when it comes to interpersonal relationships... ""is this what I am going to get if I get a girlfriend? That's not worth it.""

I think I am getting to the end of this. I feel like I am missing some things I wanted to say, but I am glad that I've got at least this out of me. Happy New Year and let's hope the things get better.",3,"Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems.I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years.

I've built myself into a robust, hermit, cold, sociopathic character, but every once in a while who I would have been if my life went differently bursts through. I'm known for being extremely isolated in my family, and I have forced myself to be okay with being lonely, and it worked, it's my preferred state and I love it. But sometimes something goes off and I just realize I need people. I crave people. Therapists struggle to understand me(do you have any idea what an alienating feeling that is? This guy is supposed to fucking know, and he's looking at me like I'm a nut job), what about friends? What about a girlfriend? I failed high school, I'm alone, I have no skills nor do I want any, I don't believe in school in the first place, I don't believe in dedicating my life to some worthless fucking job, fuck that. I didn't ask to live and I'm not okay with the way I'm being forced to live. All this stress people talk about is stress that was created and it doesn't need to be there, and old fucks tell you 'when you grow up you'll understand' like I don't understand it, you're just accepting it, you're not okay with it, it doesn't make anymore sense, you just conformed and that's not okay, you're putting your ass in the air and you're just accepting that you're getting fucked, and you're okay with that because it's easy. I don't want to conform. I don't believe in this, I'm not built for this, I want to die. I am afraid, I'm alone, and I fear that I won't last any longer. I'm scared. I'm fucking frightened. I'm sick of people trying to push 'meaning' down your throat. Not a thing means anything and I will never not believe that. I don't give a fuck about what valuable skills you think I need to have. I want to live the way I want to live, and there's nothing wrong with that, and I'll never not feel like that and because of this I'm going to die, either soon and painfully. Or I'm gonna accept it and fucking kill myself, because I WILL NOT be able to cope with it for long.

"This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.


Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.


If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?


Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.



My plan as well as tips for tonight:


- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)


- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)


- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)


- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)


- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)


- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in


- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)


- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)


- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight


- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday

I'm a graduate student in a field I've always wanted to be in, working with a world-renowned adviser; I have a supportive family, am relatively attractive and intelligent, and a great SO. By all accounts should be thrilled with the life I'm living. Obviously I'm not or I wouldn't be posting here. 

My motivation is basically gone, as is my confidence in myself and my passion for the work I'm doing. All I want to do is lie around and watch TV all day, and lately, that's all I've been able to do. My goal yesterday was to make it out of bed before 12 pm. 12 PM!!!! I'm an adult, that's ridiculous! 

I was a vegan for moral reasons for a long time, was a healthy eater, cooked nightly, and was in great shape from tons of yoga and working out. Now, I'm lucky if I do some light stretching and cook once a week.

I can't focus on anything. Trying to get work done is like running uphill in two feet of snow holding a bag of rocks. When I try to concentrate it feels like there is a cloud in my head that information can't get through. It's so frustrating and exhausting and I just can't handle it anymore. 

I've always had obsessive thoughts, and had a bit of OCD as a teenager, but now they're just constant and are affecting every aspect of my life. I know they're not rational, and I know not to let myself get fooled into believing them, but when I'm as vulnerable as I have been lately it's a challenge. 

It's taken me months to accept the fact that I might be depressed and not just a lazy, unmotivated pos, even though that's what I feel like. I've struggled with making excuses for myself and my behavior all my life; my mother rationalizes everything she does and never takes responsibility when she isn't handling things the way she should, and I think I've overcompensated in the wrong direction. This acceptance is a huge, painful step for me but I'm proud of myself for finally getting here. I think I need to accept that I need help and can't combat this alone. This isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something to confront head on and something the great, supportive people in my life can help me with.

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with.

"I know we've all been through a lot this year. Some have experienced loss and others have been on the edge of their lives. 

I'm not going to be one of those people that gets super excited because its a new year because although its a new year tomorrow is still only Sunday. I've been reflecting all day unfortunately about the past year. The first half was pretty decent. I still had a wife and wasn't alone. Then the second half I lost it all. My wife, my car, my house and my family. I hate this so much. I've also lost a lot of friends that apparently can't handle someone who has depression which in my opinion is a stupid reason to not be someone's friend anymore.

My life's stock dropped a ton of points this year and I haven't been this depressed since my mom died 20 some years ago and I was abused. I miss the friends I had, but at the same time I guess they never really were my friend to begin with. 

Sadly, I feel like here at r/depression is the only place anymore where I can freely say how I feel without anyone else judging me. Without anyone else running away from me. If I posted this on social media people would just think I'm ""begging for attention"" when in reality this is simply how I feel. I hate knowing that I am always one to listen to what others are going though and able to sympathize, but that never seems to be a two-way street. It's as if I have some sort of disease and they stay away from me when I need them the most.

I also hate it when people say ""do it yourself"" ""build yourself up"" or my personal favorite ""you don't need anyone"" its so simple to say when you are the one that isn't depressed. I also hate it because I am a guy and other guys say ""you need to man up and stop being a bitch about this"" 

I wish I had an actual friend outside of here. I've resorted to Tinder and other ""dating"" apps but I suppose I'm not attractive enough either.

I've been really depressed, and today is the same. My friends are having a potluck, but I just want to sleep. Last time I hung out, I didn't feel like I fit in. It takes so much energy to leave the house.

I was taking Adderall and desipramine before, but last term was rough. After school ended, I stopped taking the Adderall, as I noticed that I grew tolerant to it. I'm scared to try another medication.

I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing.

"I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them.

"Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"I was wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication, specifically Wellbutrin. Some personal context, I was diagnosed in October of 2015, I had been on a variety of medication up until March of 2016 at which point I settled on Wellbutrin. I have been on 300 mg of Wellbutrin ever since.

I just finished my first semester at college, and over the course of the semester I have had some ups and downs. However, overall the experience has been a net positive. I made some great friends, enjoyed two of my classes, and didn't completely fail my classes.

In the last two months I noticed that my medication was having very little effect. Depression-wise, I have hit a plateau. I wasn't getting better, but I was also not hitting too many lows.

I started occasionally skipping days on taking my medication. Not completely intentionally, I would just put it off to later due to other priorities (studying for finals) and just end up forgetting to take it. I met with a new psychiatrist (from the college) with whom I discussed the feelings of hitting a plateau, and got a prescription bump to 450 mg (I didn't mention that I occasionally skipped days).

In the past couple of days, almost a week at this point, I haven't taken any Wellbutrin at all. I feel just fine.

Since I have had depression for almost year now, I forget what feeling normal is like. I can't tell if I am back to ""normal"" or if my current feelings are the ""new normal"".

I know I should (and probably will) talk to the psychiatrist about this, but I just wanted to hear some anecdotal accounts of anyone who has tried to go cold turkey with Wellbutrin. I would love to get off medication if I could, but I understand that such a rapid transition can be detrimental.",3," wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication,was diagnosed in October of 2015,noticed that my medication was having very little effect.

Forgive yourself for making a bad decision and promise yourself you won't do it again, what good is it to continue to beat yourself up about it?

"About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do.

I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over. My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. 

I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing.

Despite all this, I'm one very sad, lonely bastard. But I didn't used to be...about 3 weeks ago, I was suddenly punched in the soul with a powerful depression that I can't seem to shake. 

Things I enjoyed doing before don't interest me at all. I spend most of my time sitting in bed reading about depression and listening to sad music. Interestingly, the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness. This is strange for me, because I've always been an introvert...I've always preferred to stay alone and would often make up excuses for why I couldn't go do stuff with friends. I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone. I want to go out and meet cute girls...but I can't...being introverted is so ingrained in me that I can't seem to go out and meet people. Oh, I've gotten out a couple times...I'll go to a bar, take a seat in the back, drink a couple beers alone then head home without a word to anyone. And then I beat myself up for failing at what I was supposed to do.

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl. Yay my brain...thanks bud.

"I have had suicidal thoughts almost every day since I was around nine years old. I have been on a few different types of anti depressants:
Zoloft
Effexor 
Celexa
Trazodone (mostly for sleep but paired with Effexor)

I don't understand why I have these thoughts. I have acted on them in the past and obviously I survived. Sometimes I have them when my mood is really bad and things are really hard. Thoughts are like: it would be easier if I just ended this. I'm tired of living.

Other thoughts happen when I am generally rather happy or even excited. The thoughts are more like: yes this is nice, but life honestly feels so monotonous or pointless. It'd be better if I died. I don't have a purpose here. I get in the way. These people don't actually care about me. I'm too much trouble and I am a burden. They would be a lot happier not having to deal with me. I should just kill myself. It would have been better if I had died last time I tried.

And other times it's very random. Such as when I'm driving. They bother me a lot and I was recently told it wasn't normal to have thoughts like this. I used to think everyone would think things like this from time to time, but I was told that they don't and it disturbed me.

My moods are difficult to handle at times. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sometimes I'm doing very well and feel pretty confident about things. I set goals. But when it crashes, I feel miserable and I quit eating, bathing, and generally just taking care of things. It's like looking through someone else's eyes. Like what I'm doing doesn't matter and I don't know why I'm bothering to do it. 

I haven't ever told anyone the real extent of my suicidal thoughts. No one knows I have them almost daily. When I told an individual I had them, she believed it was only in that moment and a couple of times. 

I wanted some advice. The thoughts scare me. Right now I wouldn't act on them. But I have tried a couple of times- as a teenager and once at 21 that I still don't know how I lived from and thankful I did. I was not hospitalized. Did it alone and stayed alone for about a week afterwards.

Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school. 

So here I am. Almost 30 and have nothing and no one except my mom. And it numbs me. Paralyzes me every second of my life. I can't even enjoy a movie now. Can't watch how all these tall men on the screen live their beatiful and interesting lives without hating myself for my life choices. So I just stuck in my apartment playing videogames all day to silence the pain while mother paying my bills. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing brings joy. All I wanna do is to die.

I've been separated since fathers day and it's been tough on me as I see her with different guys and the one she's with now she claims she loves but that part that gets me is we've had sex once we kiss and grope each other and we had another experience where it almost happened again. If that's the case and she claims she loves this guy then what the fuck is going on? I can't keep doing this, she's put me through so much shit. My oldest son is not biologically mine but I stepped up and stayed in the picture and till this day he sees me as father/daddy, that's a huge step right there.

"Everyone on the street was pretty much drunk but also filled with happiness for 2017. 

As for myself, I came back home and cried in my shower..

",5, I came back home and cried in my shower
"Grades. Looks. Achievements. Medals. Friends.

The inferiority complex. That second word ... the word carries so much weight

It's like an endless competition against the world. 

Every day, every minute, every breathe, it feels like a competition.

A gladiator match. A Hunger Games type of feel.

It's a big war on who has the biggest dick.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

____________________________________________________

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way.

"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me.

I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time...

Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

I have neglected my friends so I feel very alone. I am about to finish uni and I don't know what I want with my life now that the plans I made with my ex have all fallen through. I know that others value me but I don't value myself. 

I keep thinking about my last relationship and about everything I lost. I still can't understand how my ex could have cheated. It was so out of character and we had both agreed on numerous occasions that cheating was the most despicable thing you could do to a person. I want someone to fill the gap in my life which is loving someone and being loved but I have no idea if that will ever happen again which just adds to the feeling of hopelessness. Now I'm finishing uni I don't even know where I'd even meet someone new.

I want to say I can over-ride how I am feeling and logic my way out of it. I know that the way I am feeling is chemicals in my brain and how it's irrational and all the rest of it but understanding why I feel shit doesn't stop me feeling shit.

"Something that has begun recently in the last 2 years is my overwhelming depression. I have a friend who lets just call Tyler. Its not his real name. A girlfriend called.... Maria? Sounds good. And a best friend lets call Shana. For the longest time I never had a depressed state, even when I was in high school. I always seemed to just be doing fine and that's mostly because I was good at something. Video games have been my life, they used to become my cherished center where I could always go to escape life for a few good hours and come back refreshed. Where I had so much fun seeing developers make these stunning worlds and querky characters. It gave me the best years of my life, now its become a hellscape of depression and sorrow. 

Not all games, Undertale was a big helper in my dark times. Yet to this day most games give me this bitter feeling. So the reason why is im not good at anything, nothing at all. In real life I have no talent. In my job im seen as the weakest link (in all 7 which i got fired from my last recently) because I am physically weak. I have an issue where I am unable to remember simple things but can remember the most complex passwords. I can't even remember my own name some days and I actually stand there thinking about it. I have no money and nor do I care but I was made fun of it alot. So video games was my big deal right? Unfortunately as of late my friends became so engrossingly good at it i can't deal with it.

My girlfriend can beat me at everything. Were having fun and I think its going to be a good time so we play Battleblock Theater for example. She always gets to the end on every single level, and gets most if not all the gems first. She uses these weird tricks and the thing is she has no previous experience before.....but she always wins. So much so she apologizes for it and rubs it in by saying shell let me go ahead..... like im a stupid child. Tyler on the other hand beats me at everything as well and makes it worse. Say a game like God Eater. I practice against a monster maybe 30 to 40 times. I even spent an entire day trying to master this fight against 1 creature. So game comes down and were playing with another friend but I die not once but 6 times. Hes laughing at me saying its easy and im a loser for dieing. He laughed even more pointing out he got an SSS rank (the highest) while i got a B..... cause i died entirely. I also play games like Overwatch and Killing Floor and even on those games he gets golds across the board and recently after losing on God Eater he flat out said ""Why do we even have you here?"" refering to our new friend getting the game, so he kicked me out and just now as I type they are all beating the final boss of the game with the new guy proving hes completely surpassed me....he uses my same weapon and all and called me ""Useless"" and saying ""I should kill myself"" .....i should, I truely believe failures like me should be euthanised. Make room for the great and the growing. If you have nothing at my age of 24 you should be removed from this earth and ground into fodder. im useless im garbage i hate myself i hate living and i hate freaking everything now, my life is just filled with failures and holding everyone back and im not good at a single thing no matter how hard i try or cry or sweat or work and nothing ever works out and even if i practice ghours after hours i alwys end up just being last dead last i want to win once i want someone to say i fucing matter at anything!

For me I have a few bands and songs that I enjoy putting on replay for hours.
(Alternative) ""Off With Their Heads"" is a band I found that relates. ""HOME"" is my favorite album for them.
(Metal) Bullet for my Valentine has 2 songs I really enjoy being ""Deliver us from evil"" and ""No way out"".
I also really enjoy (Metal) ""Counterparts"" for their angsty hard metal music.
Another favorite of mine since I was young is (Alternative) Senses Fail. I especially recommend their new album ""Pull the thorns from your heart"".
Finally, because this is probably rather long, I really enjoy (Alternative) bands Brand New and La Dispute. They talk about themes that relate to depression as well and are quite different from most bands I know.

"So today is still new years eve in the states. I'm on a relatively cheap vacation to ski country in Colorado that my brother won for $100 and only invited me cause I happened to be there when he won. 

Now last weekend at Christmas I met my cousin's gf (same age, 21) and she was great and talked all the the party so that made it bearable. Now I have developed some feels for this girl but she is already taken and by my cousin none the less so I feel even worse for liking her. Tonight in Colorado we saw a flare parade down the mountain which culminated in a fireworks show. And here comes the title of the post: during the finale of the fireworks, I'm surrounded by family, and people cheering and all I can think is ""I wonder if I laid on the tube of the fireworks would it kill me?"" and at don't even feel bad...

"On his deathbed in the hospital, he pointed at me, shaking his head and said, ""You're no good.""

That was 9 years ago?

I've always thought that it was all nonsense, I don't believe in the whole 'dying person's prophecies' as my family calls it. But now that I'm in my early 20s, still plagued with depression, and having a mindset of not wanting to work... I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become.

I know fate is our own to carve, I don't want to get into the whole determinism VS free-will debate but I believe that we should all be responsible for our choices. And right now, although I'm still employed, I have seriously considered quitting several times, and what's my reason? I'm tired of work. Real tired of working.

My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR.

Sigh... Life is a meaningless trudge, we all die some day, so why can't I die soon? Maybe if I know that I'll die soon, I could quit my job and not worry about saving for retirement! Wishful thinking...

"I have several problems. One of them is that I'm 52 years old and don't have a job currently. I've tried searching for jobs and applying but I can't find any.

Roughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.

I feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. 

Personally I would like to leave tonight but I have a ""non weight-bearing"" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.

I constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions. Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated...

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while... Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain.

I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space.

What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way.

Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc.

I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy.

I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know. It may sound cliche, but my change in view coincided with the new year's eve, so I may as well grab the chance.

"In twenty-five years of existence, 2016 has had to have been the worst year of my life. I have lost nearly every friend that was truly dear to me when the year started. One stole a pretty substantial amount of money from me, another was that ones twin, another ridiculed and belittled me behind my back to try to get into bed with an ex of mine, etc. Although, a woe from the year before, I am also dealing with my best friend marring and moving across the country. Any thing even remotely romance related is a self destructive mess. I was introduced to a young women and her young son back in July. We talked for a while and I was instantly head over heels for this girl. The first person I had really been interested in after calling off an engagement in early 2015. I proceed to spend the next six months busting my ass for someone that only sees me when it is convenient to her, under the self illusion that she had just been burnt to many time and had suffered a rough enough home life that she would just take time to warm her up to the idea of something steady. She has done me wrong some many times in that time that I've lost count. Last week she calls me wanting help because they have no where to go. What can i do, put a two year old on the street? The entire time up until last night has been decent, then she drops on me that some guy is blowing her up because they went on one date and she won't go on another. Mind you, in the time I've know her, she's bailed on every single date we have had planned that involved anything more than hanging out at my place. We had plans for me to take them out to dinner tonight. Where am I? At home, with a bourbon on the rocks, being a burden on the rest of the Reddit society on New Years. Mean while, she is out with her ""friends"" and wont respond to anything. So, cheers to 2017.

"According to Spotify, I was in the top 1% of listeners for Counting Crows and The National for the year. That got me thinking and I realized, I only ever feel to music. Here's a few songs that I really connect with and maybe we can swap songs or something?

**Possibility Days by Counting Crows**

&gt; Now ""living in smiles is better"", you say but we carry the burdens of all of our days, so I'm scared that you‚Äôll leave and you‚Äôre scared that I'll stay. It's an impossibility day, but we only say half the ballet.

also

&gt; I said, ""good night, goodbye""
Seems like a good thing,
So you know it's a good lie.
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head
When you‚Äôre lying in bed and it says that the best part of a bad day
Is knowing it's ok;
The color of everything changes,
The sky rearranges its shade,
And your smile doesn‚Äôt fade,
Into a phone call
And one bad decision we made.

I view that last section as the voice you use to lie to yourself, trying to make yourself feel less like shit. The former section is how I feel about friendships that shattered when they found out I have depression, or if they don't explicitly know then how they treat me on my awful days.

**The Watchmaker by Steven Wilson**

&gt; Eliza, dear, you know there's something I must say. I've never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway...

also

&gt; You were just meant to be temporary while I waited for gold. Then we counted the years and I found I liked having someone to hold. But for you I had to wait, until one day it was too late.

I've had relationships where I didn't really feel for the other person, but just kept going because having someone there is nice. I regret both of these and this song really highlights that regret to me.

**Shemovedon by Porcupine Tree**

&gt; So for a while, everything seemed new. Did we connect, or was it just biding time for you?

&gt; She changes every time you look. By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on. She called you every other day so savor it it's all gone, cause she's moved on.

I connect this song very vividly to a girl I knew who feigned interest in even just a friendship. I thought we had something and formed a strong crush on her but she started getting cold. I confronted her multiple times but she kept hold the position that it was all okay. Eventually I got confirmation that she was avoiding any conversations with only me, and I confronted her last time and just got the message, ""I'm sorry."" Now thanks to a unique name, every time I even see her name somewhere it feels like a punch to my gut. So this song makes me extremely emotional, especially the guitar solo.

___
**Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks by The National**

&gt; Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Oh the waters a rising, still no surprising you. Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'. I'll explain everything to the geeks.

I listened to this album around when I was 12 (yet to deal with depression) and fell in love with it. This was always my favorite song off it and never really knew why. I still don't really know why but have at least kind of a reason. It's one of the few where I can bawl my eyes out to any day. Just the chorus gives a kind of soothing, understanding, almost loving feel? It's just pleasant.

"So at least i made it this far, finally writing something here after lurking for a long time. 

I'm not entirely sure why I am so sad all the time, there is almost nothing in my life I feel I can complain about. I was never bullied, I have a loving supportive family, haven't been sick in a few years so somewhat healthy(although i drink a lot of coke), average intellect, average height, skinny. I have such low interest in things that my little income is way higher than rent+food. I went to the movies 2x this whole year, no hobbies to speak of (Watching TV shows and browsing the internet is barely a hobby).

I tried finishing my Computer Science degree at some point but every year went something like: School-&gt;Work during summer-&gt;Some school-&gt;Depression-&gt;Quit school. Had quite a few hobbies that started out fun and engaging but then got boring fast so I found another one. Now I feel like I have spent all my options for short-time happiness and I'm getting closer to the deep end of depression.

Everything I used to love to do just seems pointless right now, everything I aspired to be has vanished, I'm still fairly young(almost 30) but feels like life is passing me by. I have never had a partner or even kissed someone and people around me are having kids and successful careers.
I have now had a stable job for a year and it is killing me. I hate that job because I find it so meaningless, it's just an entry level IT job but deep down I feel like I should be doing something else. My friend recommended me for that job and now they are firing him because I have a little more education than him. That has not made our relationship stronger, he says it's no big deal but I can't but blame myself somehow, and I can't just quit because the rent would eventually eat my reserves and I would have to move back to my mother.

I don't know where this rant is going, just feeling quite bad that another year has gone by and I'm going less and less out of the house. Depression has hit like a truck over the holidays and I'm having a hard time seeing anything positive happening in the near future.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult.

I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again.

The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate.

I feel like my only desires are to pass the time until I can die without hurting my loved ones, and to minimize any negative impact I may have on those around me along the way. I figure if I can't be happy, I might as well not bring others down.

"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey.

"I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit.

Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. 

Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me.

Their reactions were...not good.

My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that.""

My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though.

I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc.

My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?""

Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. 

I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon.""

My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset.""

Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him.

A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. 

I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.",4,"sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations!

"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).  I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible.

"Earlier this year my uncle was looking for someone to work for him. The job was very interesting to me. It's the kind of job I was truly interested in. Long story short I needed to go to school for a course that took 4 months to work for my uncle. Once I was done with the course my uncle told me he had already found someone else.

But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason.

"I finally got the guts to post this, especially because I just came from a new years eve party and it's 4.33 AM and i'm just in a 'fuck it' kind of mode, I need some motivational help.

I feel like im a fucking failure at everything I do, I just turned 18 2 days ago, and time keeps going and going yet it seems I'm always in the same shitty place.
I don't feel okay with myself, i'm kinda short, i'm chubby, and let's face it, no girl wants a guy like that in her life. I just got home from a party just like I said, went over to have fun with some college friends (crush included) and hey, look at that, she's drunk and is spewing the truth through her mouth left and right. I've been 2 months so far gathering courage to just talk to her directly ( we have a group chat on facebook and we talk daily, 24/7 ) and do something about but there's always that mental block of 'hey she doesnt want you you're a loser look at you', and when I finally am about to do something about it, she just starts talking about how 'she misses *name_from_guy_from_our_groupchat *' and shit like that. All that built up courage went down in mere seconds.

And it's not even the first time this happens, I've been this whole summer talking to one of the best girls i've ever met (we know each other for like 4 years but we only talked more seriously this year) and it really felt like she was the one but then again, all that courage i've been building that whole time back then went down again the moment I knew I wasn't going anywhere, seems like I was being friendzoned.
We still talk, I even met her again today in the new years eve party after I left my college friends, but it seems like one day she really likes me but then other days she just ignores me completely, like for example, she gets really pumped up and invites me to the cinema but then she cancels the next day, i don't know her deal. 

I think I'm way too nice and caring but that's just the way I am and I can't stop it that easily, but it's FUCKING up my relationships with girls because I want to be with them but they just assume i'm their good kind friend who doesn't want anything.

I always get motivated and say to myself 'This is the day/month/year, that everything changes, from now on, I'll go to the gym everytime I can and start acting a different way with people blablabla', it works for the first few days or weeks, but it just burns down completely and I end up doing nothing. Endless loop. 

People say you gotta love yourself before you love others, I really need help loving myself then, because I just feel like time is flying away and I'll end up dying single, which is literally hell for me because I care so much about relationships and friends. I'm really grateful for the friends I have, but I just want that one special person to share all my moments with...",4,"I'm short and chibby, gathering courage to talk to her directly, she dosent want you, friendzoned"
"dsAIm 18, about to be 19 in a month (Feb.1) and a male, if that matters. 

As im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year. Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room. I have no connection to my parents, i feel so alone on new years eve when everyone else is having fun. All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are ""friends"" and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, ""youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself."" ""You need to eat less"" ""youre a terrible driver"" things like that. Im not too fat imo but im not thin either, i have manboobs and i hate them, and i genuinely want to better myself, but its hard without support. For the past week or so ive just wanted to curl up in my bed and cry, and its only as im typing this post that im finally getting that release, i genuinely dont know where else to turn. I have an overwhelming fear of there being no afterlife and just nothingness after death that cripples me and keeps me awake at night which no one ive talked to yet acknowledges. I just feel like im in a shitshow and i have no one here to help me through it, and all i want is to be happy but it feels like that just isnt possible for me. Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.",4,"bother and sister are out at separate parties, I feel so alone,  mom rarely talks to me, dad isnt good at being supportive ,stepmom hates me"

"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4q2zxb/im_going_to_kill_myself_on_123116/

I'm so fucking annoyed and tired of feeling like only 1/2 a person all the time, feeling a whirlwind mix of negative emotions but never feeling positive ones except in rare, fleeting circumstances. I don't deserve this. Maybe it's caused by childhood trauma, maybe it's genetics, maybe it's just shit luck, I don't know for sure, but I sure as hell didn't ask to be plagued with social anxiety and depression; I won't allow 2016 and how shitty it was to kill me. Yes, I became suicidal a month into it, yes I hated myself for most of the year and used self-deprecating humor to express how I felt, yes I started self-harming and cutting myself over the summer and did it more or less regularly for the rest of the year, yes my anxiety reached new heights and started interfering with my life and career, but what do I say to that? I'M FUCKING DONE. I have done nothing to deserve this. I've done some regrettable things in my life, but nothing so bad that would make suicide a justifiable decision. I want to taste happiness and ""feeling okay"" for once--and not just that, but for a long time; I know I'm naturally prone to feeling depressed and like shit, but that doesn't mean I need to accept it. Even if I'm going to die, it doesn't need to be by my own hand, at the end of a gun barrel pressed against the side of my skull. I want to have a successful and flourishing career, I want to have fun in my 20s's, I want to experience all that is, I want to fall in love. Deep inside my head, there's still that part of me who wants to sabotage everything I strive for, who wants me to kill myself, who picks up the knife and cuts myself, who tells me I'm an unattractive piece of shit who should die. Fuck that guy. I will not go gentle into that good night. I will rage, rage against the dying of the light. I will make 2017 my bitch.",4," tired of feeling like only half a person al the time,  caused by childhood trauma, may be gentics"
"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. 
I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. 
The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.

"This is sorta long, sorry

I was diagnosed since 15 years ago with autism (30 yo male BTW). I don't know how I even manage to have 2 long term relationships (2 and a half years everyone) in the last 5 years, now in a third one with my first boyfriend (23 m). Even have I have maintain a job for more than 2 years I don't know how being depressed, obsessive over simple things and even bullied in this one multiple times (some for my sexuality) but learn to deal with that.

I work at costumer service, I literally has to assume another identity in order to survive that day to day and the stress that comes from attend people directly.

I'm pretty much afraid from almost everyone, I think they are going to do me some damage, I think I has PTSD since I was badly beaten with a metal tube and almost killed in a public place back in 2013. I was OK, but since pretty much like march 2016 i begin with constant attacks of anxiety in the work and in public places, I was constantly alert about my surrounds, six month ago, back to June I have my first anxiety and panic attack on a public event with rich people in where my boyfriend was attend to, he almost broke with me then, I go to 2 therapist but they cant do anything with my case, they don't even know how to diagnose me. 
Again my boyfriend try to broke with me mid September, I almost kill myself, come to a mental institution but neglected being interned, but they gave me medication (Prozac and klonopin). I was with two psychiatrist since then, but they still don't know my diagnosis. I finally have a appointment with a specialist on January 3 to validate and see my case to make a formal diagnosis.

But something happens today on the morning (December 31); my boyfriend want to break with me, now this time seriously, I cried, I scream, I have the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, he said that he loves me deeply, but when I was with other people (like friends of him) I change totally, my voice, my manners, my way of speak, walking, acting, thinking, even what I speak of changes totally, the worst of this? I don't have consciousness this happens, I remember been there and all but, didn't notice these changes. My boyfriend hates deeply this ""personality"" I don't know of till today.
We talk and talk, he gives me a second chance (even The fact I don't deserve it, but love him so much I don't want he to go). But now I'm afraid, not only by the anxiety and the depression I am, but too from this ""Personality"" I don't even know.

"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? 








Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me.

"She wants kids. I fucking despise children and cringe when one is around me. And I would have to have one around me every day as a father. I'd need to PRIORITIZE THEM over my own life. That's completely horrifying to me.

She's left. I'm right.

I drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.

I enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.

I should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. 

So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with ""she was too good for me, anyway"", leave it at that, and move on with my life.

So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.

But, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.

But I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.

Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. 

I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.

Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.

Well, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say ""Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body"" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. 

I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.

But I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.

I can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.

I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.

"I've had depression for a while now and I've slightly lost contact with most friends. I decided to throw a party to get back in touch with them. I had a great time before the party. I had pre-drinks with a couple of mates and it was chill, I felt calm and like myself. I should mention that last month I was dumped and cheated on during a long distance relationship that last 7-Months so the girl I'm about to talk about is the first girl I've had feelings for since. Towards the party I wanted to talk to my crush who was invited. We've been friends for a couple of years and in the past month I've invited her to a movie and surprised her with coffee before Christmas. I've been warming up to asking her on a proper date but when the party started. I relapsed. I've been feeling great up to this point. I shut down, I was a shell the whole night. She was surrounded by guys all the time and I didn't even get to say hello let alone have enough courage to. I was isolating myself for most of the night, even when it's my own party. Friend's comforted me and wanted to help but I just shut them out. The countdown to 2017 came and I left to my garage. I didn't want to see anyone. People left around 1:30am and I said goodbye acting really appreciative that they came. I'm happy they came but not during the night, I just wanted to be alone. The next day I apologize for not talking and just let out my feelings for her. She just thanked me for the night and ignored what I said about her. Now my day is ruined because I overthink.

"Why is the best advice always to confront them and have your heart be broken and move on, or you are still young, you will find the right person. If you truly fallen in love someone, not just by their physical appearance, it definitely is not something you can simply move on. I have known this girl for 8 years and i am so deeply in love with her, but i know she would never love me back. I consider her my closet friend but i know she does not. I know if i disappear she would not care. We talk almost everyday, play video games, and from time to time hang out as a group, but i know these things mean nothing to her other than a social outlet. The amount of things i have done for her, be there for her when her pet of 13 years passed away, be there when no one else would, go out of my way to help her studies, travel overseas after having a surgery just because she told me she wanted someone to hang out with, all those things i know meant nothing to her. I know that if someone doesn't love you, no matter what you do they won't, I am not spiteful about her not loving me back, i know she owes me nothing but it just hurts so much. She is the first person in my life that when she felt sad, i would feel sad as well, when she is happy, i would be happy. She is by no means amazing looking, but every time i look at her, i would see the most beautiful girl i have seen in my life. I can just spend the whole day looking at her, i can't even imagine loving any other girl other than her.

"Edited: changed some of the wording, and fixed a typo. I wrote this in a hurry.

Hello. The situation is as follows:

I suffer from extreme depression. I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no ""abnormal"" traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.

I went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.

Sophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. 

I went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. 

 Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. 

One of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.

Time goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. 

Fast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.

As I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren't great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.

It is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. 

Fast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. 

Part of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn't from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.

I ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.

Again, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.

Can someone please help me? I've been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting. At least 10 people in 2 days have desired to write letters of support. I want to know if the absurdity of this leaves me another option other than crying. I know this is unfair, but the difference about this and, say, a bad referee call, is that this decision threatens my well-being and crushes the little chance I have to recover.",3,"Depression, OCD,engineering, Sophomore year dealt with pain, drunk, suicidal thoughts, hospiatized, abused by security guards,   dean, asked to leave"
"I'm a high school senior and my high school experience has been quite rocky to say the least. Not only am I quite socially awkward and have close to no friends, living with my parents has made my anxiety and depression worse and worse every year. They don't accept a lot of things about me and I'm constantly berated by them. Their marriage isn't great either and a lot of times, they displace that anger onto me verbally. It's New Years Eve and I'm in my room alone, since they were arguing earlier and I dont have any friends to hang out with.
The only thing thats keeping me going is knowing that this is the last new years eve that I'm stuck in this hell. I will be moving out next year for college as an adult. I will finally be in charge of my life and its going to be up to me what kind of environment i will be in. I won't constantly be subjected to their bullshit anymore.

"Call it FOMO, jealousy, whatever you wish. I have spent 22/24 hours of each day for the past 12 months at home, in a 10x12 room staring at a fucking computer screen, because I have lost the energy to do anything else. This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.). I have been to about 12 or so medical professionals, had 3 CTs, 2 xrays, been on 20 different medications, and they can't figure out why I'm sick. They say I don't have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I'd cry in relief. I've seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah. At least I'm not hungry, though, right? That's supposed to make you feel better, comparing your misfortune to others'. The problem with that is your experiences are exactly that. You can't help but view your continuing chain of fucking shit problems as well, exactly that, to be rather repetitive. I don't know, I guess I'm ranting. I feel like I'm taking up space. I even thought about what my room would be used as once I'm not around anymore, whatever that ends up meaning. Maybe Mom could convert it into an office. That'd be nice. I do live at home, but at least that's for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That's transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program. He has Alzheimer's and Dementia and I keep an eye on him. God knows why they trust me with him. I'm the fucking psychotic asshole, right? I could keel over any minute (hopefully) and then what? I guess he'd go to a nursing home. So I suppose I'm a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don't know. I just want to fade away without harming anyone else, or myself for that matter. I don't -want- to die, but I don't see much of any other option. Not that I'd do it myself, I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it. I guess I'm stuck. Just skip this post, it's a waste of time.

This year has been nothing but negativity for me, not just because of all the negativity the media has been flaunting around in our faces about the horrible celebrity deaths, but because of my three deaths in my family. All of which I was extremely close to.

I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as ""normal"" would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.

But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don't have my life even 1% figured out. I'm 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they've always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they've always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it's fake and blah blah blah but it's what he wants to do and I've been supportive of him. I work at Lowe's, it's a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don't feel like it's enough though. I don't feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don't know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.

I've spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I'm just very unsocial and it's extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I'm also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it's just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they're even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don't really know what's wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?

What I'm trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don't appeal to anyone and I don't have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don't finwant to invite myself into peoples' plans and I don't want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me.

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"warning: fairly negative post. 

Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. 

   Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. 

   These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me.

   I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come.

I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around.

"I really kinda just want to vent a little I guess? I have terrible general and social anxiety that feeds into my depression, and I live a fucking nightmare. I know (because others have told me, however won't say what was said) that people talk about me behind my back. I don't know what they say ever, and I also don't know who does. This is brutal as far as my anxiety goes, and I have a tendency to catastrophize over small things, and it spirals until I'm a dysfunctional mess. More recently, I've been paranoid that none of my friends actually care about me, since they seem to be avoiding me irl more recently. I have friends that are depressed and understand how I feel when it comes to my depression, but they give off the same vibe and I'm at a loss. Beyond that, I'm currently in a really fucked up domestic situation. I haven't seen my dad in coming up on a year now, mainly because he was somewhat emotionally abusive for a while, and I couldn't take it anymore, and my mom and stepdad are always almost 5 hours from me with the exception of holidays. I'm 17, finishing high school while living with my grandparents. I stayed here for 2 reasons: Transferring schools for senior year would suck, and I value my relationships here a lot, but like I said before my relationships seem to be falling apart. Being with my grandparents stresses me out, and it's hard on them too, so I just feel like a burden to them. I talk to 2 different therapists, and I am on 3 different medications for my depression and none of them help. The only time I ever have felt happy recently was the one time I got high smoking weed with a couple friends a few weeks ago. I was in a relationship from May of two years ago until November of this year, and she broke up with me for what I feel like was a bogus reason. I was in a skype call with some people and after a while of not talking I just left because I couldn't handle it anymore and felt like I was just there to feel like people cared about me for once. I didn't feel like they actually did anymore and I've spent the rest of the night feeling like shit. I feel like such a nuisance, and that my existence is a bother to everyone, including myself. I wish there was a way to disappear, and not have anyone remember I ever was there.

The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October.

I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself.

I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".

It was one of the happiest times of my life.  It was great until the next school year.  Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons.  When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school.  Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill.  I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text.  I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school.  My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in.  In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.

"I've been experiencing depression for around 6-7 years now, and there's a theme I've found in my experience when I'm not in a terrible, suicide attempt-filled rut: I feel as though I settle for everything.  Whether it be my skills as a musician (one of the few things I cherish in life), my relationship status, or my career/educational field.  I currently am not as good of a guitarist as I should be, if I actually put in more work.  I'm very lazy, and almost scared to do it, for fear that I will fail.  I'm settling for my mediocre skills there.  I'm seeing someone, and have been for a little over three months (with a one week break in the middle there), who I don't love.  She's a great friend, but i would admit that since it's my first term, I really did jump at the first chance I had for a relationship.  She's madly in love with me, but I have no feelings for the greater part of the time we've been together.  I'm afraid of being alone.  I'm aware I'm hurting her by doing this, and she doesn't even know it.  So I'm also settling in the relationship realm.  On top of those two, I just started last fall at a college I don't enjoy being at.  Don't get me wrong, the education is amazing, and I got on the deans list for my first term, but I moved from Chicago to this rural area for college and I'm bored out of my fucking mind there.  I go back on Monday, by the way.  Fun stuff.  I'm settling here as well, because I'm getting an education somewhere that I don't necessarily enjoy being at.

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing.

Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late.

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy.

On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work.

The fact that he is depressed doesn't bother me, lots of people at my university are, and he's had a very hard life so it's not all that surprising anyway. But sometimes he does really reckless shit that I don't know how to react to in a helpful, supportive way. Specifically, tonight (NYE) he went and got suuuper drunk with some friends and wound up eating a bunch of vitamins and then forcing himself to throw up. I know this because after Danny sent me about a dozen completely unintelligible texts, one of his friends took his phone and messaged me to tell me what was up and reassure me that he was okay.

My knee jerk reaction was anger - that he would drink so much when he knows he's not supposed to mix alcohol with his medication, and that he would do something so reckless. I mean, I don't know how dangerous eating a handful of vitamins actually is, but I've heard it's bad and so has he. And he's been very suicidal before, before I met him, so the general behavior just scares me. But then again, he probably was just muching on them because they tasted good and ya know, drunk brain. 

Obviously getting mad and yelling at him or whatever isn't going to help much though. Is there a better way for me to react that still makes it clear that he upset and scared me? Some kind of general rule of thumb for dealing with this kind of behavior? General advice? Am I over thinking it? Is this the wrong subreddit (my bad if so)?

Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. 

I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all.

This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it.

Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",5,feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset
"Fair Warning: I need to talk and get stuff out there. I don't know what to do about any of this other than to keep walking, I am just losing the will to believe in positive things anymore, at least for me in my life.


I've had major depressive episodes since I was 15, with these culminating in a hospital stay at 17. Since then I have tried to live with my depressive tendencies and fight, just putting one foot in front of the other and using medicine to help even me out. This year, I've hit a wall I believe.

Starting in January, I noticed my marriage of 8 years was failing, but I stuffed it back in my mind because I didn't want to admit it. This continued until the end of May when I found out about infidelity and apathy on her part. Afterward, I lost most of my support network, with only my mother and father, one life-long friend, and one 1/2 life long friend remaining to help (I lost my extended family 6 or 7 years ago because of lawsuits arising from a death in the family). There is a lot of hurt on both sides, but at this point in time, I don't feel anger will fix anything. I would rather try to get thru this and let her find what she is looking for somewhere else.

I focused on my health to try to forget the pain and found out from my doctors that I will be lucky to live till 60 because of a complex back problem (kyphosis/stenosis/degenerative disc/degenerative bones/arthritis). I was already on pain meds for these conditions, and hoped for some type of surgery to lessen the pain; I was told I am too messed up to fix. I was also hoping to get off of Lyrica, which caused my weight to balloon to over 300 (I used to be 200-220),

I then focused on a skin condition I have and after a month long process, found out I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition that is rather depressing all by itself. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa). Because of its location (my neck), I have to treat it or it can turn into cancer, instantly spreading to my CNS and brain. I have had to start Humira, a drug that weakens your immune response in order to fight the H.S.

After going thru all of this, today I found out my wife canceled my insurance without telling me, possibly hurting my meds and causing problems with my treatments. I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don't want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments. She also told me of some problems she has now, and even though I know that she helped create those problems for herself, I feel sad that she is having to go thru them.

I am starting to wonder why I even bother having a positive outlook anymore. I'm truly afraid I am going to die alone (as in single) and possibly before my parents (they are 70 this year). I feel like I have wasted my life, accomplishing nothing and bringing pain to all around me. I'm hoping for a better 2017, but I am not holding my breath.

"   2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away,  not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it.
   I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step,  being medication,  has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do.

After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences.

Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don't get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I've never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body..

"I'm a 20 year old guy. I won't rant how bad 2016 was or anything since I go through a bad phase every now and then. Ending the year I entered another one. And I know new year new me is BS but I'm really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I've cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started '16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I'm alone, I'm trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I'm really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it's really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can't even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don't hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of 'em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. 
I have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I've to take my inhaler almost daily. 
Yes I've been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they're not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they're costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I've never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I'm thinking why people do me dirty and why I can't have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn't help as well.

He stole around 300$ from me right before he left and has done so many horrible things but I can't help but love him. I made a few mistakes after he did and he said this was the reason. He wanted to have a friends with benefits relationship right afterwards.. I almost fell for it because I wanted him. I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. 

I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken.

I guess I just want to talk to someone who is going through the same thing so we can go through it together? I don't even know what I'm saying. I don't have many friends I just really.. . really need someone right now.

"Wtf is wrong with the world ? people killing others for no reasons, people thinking money is worth more than a human life. The wolrd we live in is so depressing. I'm depressed since i'm 16 (now 19) and i'm not doing better. I take pills and i consult a psychologist but it doesn't work. I don't like doing a lot of things, when i start a new project i either fail or i lose my interest after a couple of weeks and i just give up. I don't go to school because i suck at it and i'm unemployed because i hate every job i do and it makes me even more depressed. I cry almost every night for no reason and it's very hard for me to sleep because my head is always full of shit. I'm too tired to do something but not enough to fall asleep.

I don't really know what to do to get better, at least i have friends and family that care about me and support me through this, they are the reason why i'm still here today. I just wanted to know if anyone is going through the same shit as I am.

"I spend most of my time with others pretending to be ok. Even around those closest to me, whom I've told honestly of the severity of my depression. 

If I don't, I feel worse. I feel bad for bringing everyone down, I feel bad for 'not trying hard enough' to have a good time. Like I'm intentionally doing harm to my loved ones just by acting how I feel.

So I act, I smile and laugh at their jokes or make lighthearted comments about whatever we are doing, but its an act. The entire time I'm exhausting what little energy I have just to seem normal enough they wont leave me.

But then... they actually think I'm fine. Even though I have told them it's acting. I've broken down on more occasions then i can count now. Begged for someone to help me. Begged for some support, or even just a friendly ear. And they're always nice while I'm crying, they listen to me blither for a while and promise to help.

The next day I'm faking it again cause the guilt of making them feel so bad yesterday is overwhelming. I think they'll remember, that they'll ask and actually care how I'm feeling. I think they may at the very least try to check in on me, or pick up some of the slack around the house. They might offer to drive me to my doctors, or really any gesture of support.

But weeks go by. They act like it never happened, like I never told them how I'm really feeling. So I break down again. Beg for help again. Explain it all again. They think I've actually been fine these past few weeks, even though I had blatantly told them I was acting.


Rinse.

Repeat.

Many many months later I'm still in this awful loop. I'm doing everything I can to fight this on my own, but I just can't.

"I've gone through deep depression in university from being homesick, in addition to being in remission for testicular cancer for over 3 years. I met this girl through a close friend of mine out of state. We met once and connected really well, and wanted to stay together even through long distance. She told me her feelings were genuine and I shouldn't worry about anything, and that she would not be the one breaking up with me.


Fast forward 2 months to last night, where we met up again, to which i feel that she may be avoiding or distancing herself for me. I would ask if everything is alright to which she would assure me nothing is wrong. I see her texting a friend at the show we were at where she sent a text to a friend saying ""I'm a horrible person"". I kinda figured what may be the case, and confronted her to which she slowly admitted that she's not looking for a relationship. She booked the same flight home with me to stay with and visit me where I live with my family.


I don't know where to go from here. I'm 22, been through physical and emotional stress, and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much. I am going to talk to her soon about the situation but I don't know if I want her coming home with me now. It feels humiliating to describe this amazing girl you just met to friends and family, only to be abruptly let down before we could actually spend quality time together IN PERSON. I don't know if i can have her come home with me, it's so heartbreaking to know the person you fell in love with doesn't feel the same and is right in front of you.

"There are many things that bother me about myself, and those only seemed to have intensified and even multiplied over the past year. I would say all-in-all I will remember 2016 as the years my expectations dropped so low that it has surpassed the depths of cynicism to the point that I feel no different than a (barely) sentient robot. 
2016 is also the year I managed to grow disgusted with the world by the realization that everything in the modern world just seems no different than a movie set, with the plastic wrapping still on and showing. I came to these overwhelming realizations while I've been stoned, and by this virtue I don't know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. 
The year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I've experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I've conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they're not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn't make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I've unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I've just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn't poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other's company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn't considered before that. 
To end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I'm hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. 
I hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub. Cheers and enjoy your year all

Use and throw away. Stupid. Boring. Unattractive. Terrible in bed. All I'm good for is for getting other people off and not myself. For spoiling others, because I don't want the burden of possessions for when I finally off myself. I had a nice thought earlier. Sell off all my things. Work up a travel fund. Travel to a nice place to disappear and die, probably. Somewhere that hopefully nobody I know has to deal with it.

It's been years, I'm not gonna believe this it gets better shit. There's 7.2 billion people on this earth. Happiness and contentment isn't for everyone, what if 1 billion unfortunate fucks are just supposed to live in this miasma.



For years I've just had to accept this. I don't like talking about and i don't like being aware. I don't want to acknowledge this because I'm already aware it's there and knowing it's there is enough to make me want to claw and rip everything around me to shreds and I'm so fucking close I just want to smash and rip it all away and I'm so sick of this.


It's the ULTIMATE fucking paradox TO EVERYTHING. 


Life, love, people, goals. It's just white noise and it shouldn't be. And it tears me apart.



There's a handful of people that make me really feel alive and happy and even then. It's all just temporary

"Hey reddit and happy new year everyone :)
I'm 18 and always had social issues but it's been more than a year that I've been falling down into worse and worse depression. The numerous parties I haven't gone to, the weekends I stayed home by myself, the pressure of finishing high school, the crap of feeling completely alone in the holidays (and on new year's) have led me to a new low.

I wanna focus on another aspect: people I try to talk to have no friggin clue what to tell me. 
My ""friends"" act all supportive until I actually talk to them about my issues. After that, it's like nothing has ever happened and life goes on exactly as usual, with the difference that I feel even more like the ""odd one"" in their eye. I actually have no clue how friends are meant to behave in general, so I might as well assume that's how it always goes and it's my fault for having such ugly problems.

Second, my parents. They think that insisting and trying to convince me to do anything and move my ass, and then getting angry when I either keep saying no or yell at them for what they say, is the way to go. I feel excluded even by them, as if I was a total freak, an alien (barely) walking around the house.

"Hey, first post on here!
I feel weird. I don't feel bad, just weird. I've been feeling like this for quite a while. Like two years or something.
Let me give you some background. I'm a 16 y/o dude living in Norway. I have it well. Life is good to me. 
I get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that's fine).
Everything is just fine.

But somehow I feel like my whole life is ""meh"". I don't see any point in doing anything. 
I have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. 
I go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.

I just lose motivation so quickly. ""Oh, I'll play this game."" Ten minutes go by. ""Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc."" 
Or; ""Oooh, I'll make this video game."" I work on it for 2 days. ""I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.""
I've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?

One good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming ""Happy New Year"" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. 
The number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.

I don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?

Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing.  When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her.

I've been feeling this for a good amount of years now because of a long story.

Have anyone else any experience with weed, because i've been smoking alot lately and helps me SO MUCH with my anxiety and the ""black and white"" look at the world(please don't tell me to stop, i know the risks)

Why is everything so fucking boring all the time, i feel like i am wasting my entire youth i'm 17, i don't see myself as an isolated nerd or anything i like to produce music on my computer.

I consider myself decent looking depending on the day, i'm not overweight nor skinny.

I'm so sick of being afraid of other people on and off all the time.

I'm a virgin because i'm so scared of girls. but when i am high i can actually speak to girls and make eye contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment).

When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.

Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door

I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.

i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about.

I have nightmares almost every single night.

I don't know myself, i don't know who i fucking am!

I feel like i am missing out on all the fun

Am i missing out on my youth??

I feel completely lonely in this world even though i have some friends who care about me and i have my mom.

I'm sick and tired of being tired

I think that when people are depressed the see the world as it actually is without filter, if you know what i mean.

I have so much anger inside which sometimes lead to me getting extremely angry because of small things.

So if I were to test, if this is infact what is causing it, how could I go about it? In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do.

"I mean, it was both awful and great

January was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook. I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. 

In February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, ""search"" (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. 

I was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it's very awkward to get into this when you're around 16, it's interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn't feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl's skin is clean and she's neither super over/underweight, she's fine in my eyes. 

This lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won't get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn't fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that ""those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die"". 

This showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel's back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. 

It really took away my believe in humanity. And I don't mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn't give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. 

And then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn't stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. 

It improved when spring started. I still remember thinking ""I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.""

However, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.

Now, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.

I didn't give a shit about what people thought about me, I've seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren't as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. 

And this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn't care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. 

But... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn't allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn't wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. 

And she doesn't accept that she did this. She always says now ""I didn't forbid anything"" or ""Don't make others responsible for your problems"" or ""You can still see people we know"" or ""Just search for new friends on Facebook"". Worst part is that my dad who actually would've allowed me this didn't step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...

But this made clear that I don't want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.

However, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/

Friday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn't for this, I don't think I could've stayed through the weekend. 

I think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can't even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It's just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don't feel like it's normal. 

I've never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. 

But back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. 

It did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. 

And whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad. Last year was on the other side both the best and the worst year of my life. 

Oh and: I hope the year will be good for you too. ",5,"fell into deep hole, felt very lonely , really wanted to have people around me, no friends in school, mom  prevented me from befriending classmates"
"I feel nothing.

I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago.

Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason. It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness.

Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing. I just sit there and there is nothing coming out of me at all, like an empty bowl. I don't know if ever I will experience that feeling again. I hope I will.

I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression?

He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years.

He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after.

Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates.

At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen.

"All my life I've had depression, I remember crying myself to sleep for years at about 8/9 years old, I was always an outcast. I cried myself to sleep because I couldn't understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I'm just not going to exist and I don't think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?

I made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. 
There was a 'lunchtime supervisor' I guess you'd call her who noticed I was always alone, I'd wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. 

She left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn't that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. 

Highschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl's, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. 

I've always been alone.

By yr 9, I made friends with this 'alt girl', Idk what you'd call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I'd ever been. 

I started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I'd play games with over Skype.  Good times.

Yr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.

I quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof 'followed' them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.

People would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.

I switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.

I remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I've always been so tired.

By yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn't like me but I had always kept a little influence over people. My old bestfriend (f) had stayed my friend atleast, and we were still really good friends just she'd found someone better (aka a girl) to be bestfriends with.

I'm writing this now, in the second year of college, slightly drunk after smoking once again. (I had quit vaping for exams in yr 11). I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I'm on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn't ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can't stand my past and I'm so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let's call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I've told about my depression, I've also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. 

I'm so alone rn and I realise that this isn't ever going to get better. I will always be a boy and a nobody. I'm not sure I can deal with the fact that I won't ever live the life that I've always dreamt of and I will always be mostly alone. 

I am so glad and happy that I atleast have her. 

It just doesn't feel enough anymore, I always think that ending it is just the best way to go. To be rid of my frustratingly depressing life.

Uni is going to be so hard to try achieve with my ever falling motivation, I'll try and hopefully go the same place as her and her boyfriend. It feels so fucking impossible to do anything, and I don't think anythings ever going to get better, with a pill and some therapy

"Hello everyone,
I am sorry in advance if there is any rule that I should follow when posting this.
Where do I start?

CULTURALLY:
I currently live in Canada but I was born abroad. I have been here for the past eight years and to say the least, the country I am from is very stereotyped... It is located in North Africa so I let you figure out the stigma that surrounds it. I feel alone here. I tried my hardest to make friends but none of them stuck around. I tried to befriend people from different cultures and not just stick with my own (a thing a lot of immigrants do when they move abroad) but I feel like that backfired at me... I am not religious, so my own people do not like me and I am now seen as ""the wannabe white guy"". Other people (mainly natives) get to know me but they never want to do anything with me. Truth be told, I arrived here at 16 so all the groups were formed and all the friends were ""taken"". I try to be nice to people. I try to show them the good side of my culture by inviting them to do stuff and actually paying for them (don't think I am desperate, I do this occasionally when I get a good vibe from the person) but it never works. I do very well at school and according to my brother, people do not like me because they are jealous... I am not sure what to think of that.
I used to have interests but all those disillusions faded them one by one.

EMOTIONALLY:
I have a rather strong personality but no persona. I am the same with everyone regardless of who they are (except my family of course, who I draw limits with). People think I am too straightforward and too blunt. I just do not like to do things that I do not enjoy doing and my ""friends"" get frustrated and mad at me because I do not follow the rest of the people.

MOTIVATION:
I do well at school as I said previously, but my motivation dropped drastically lately. I do the bare minimum. Thank god (or the force) I was gifted with good brains that save my lazy piece of shit ass when needed. I feel like I could do a lot more, but my depression hinders every step that I try to take.

RELATIONSHIPS:
My ex-girlfriend cheated on me, yet I got back with her. She cheated on me with my so-called ""friend"". I got back with her because, on the spot, she apologized and I felt sorry for her because she, herself, underwent severe depression before I came along and saved her. I recently broke up with her because she did not keep any of her promises and also, she is constantly on the move and never really regained my trust ever since I found out she was playing me.

I feel like I hit rock-bottom. I am deeply, deeply, deeply sad.



**TLDR**; I feel like no one accepts me for who I am.



I am really down but I would really appreciate any constructive comments.

Thank you.",5,"live in Canada but born abroad, located in North Africa, stigma, feel alone, ""wannabe white guy"", friends frustrated because donít follow rest of the guys, girlfriend cheated, broke up, very lonely"

"Today I talked to my parents for the first time about my depression I have been dealing with. I was very apprehensive and nervous about how they would react. They were very understanding and sympathetic, and my dad told me it actually runs in our family. Going to see someone next week. 
It's a start and feels like I'm on track to getting better. Anyone out there who is too nervous to reach out for help, or too proud to do it, just do it!

"I try so hard but it seems that the things I long for I may never achieve in this lifetime. It isn‚Äôt money or status that my heart aches for; it‚Äôs a strong sense of purpose. A group of individuals that I could surround myself with and call a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. It‚Äôs a longing for companionship. I spend my days alone, and they are long and empty. I wish I was dead every day. I think about suicide every day. 

I have no one to talk to, because all my friends have slowly turned into acquaintances, and they no longer have room for my ‚Äúnegative energy‚Äù in their lives. I never asked to be negative. I try so hard to better myself, to get out of my comfort zone, to talk to new people, to exercise, to meditate. I will continue to try to better myself, even for the lack of a result I experience. I will continue to try because it‚Äôs all I can do, other than commit suicide and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to hurt the few I do have that care for me.

I just wish I had someone that could understand and relate to me, and wasn‚Äôt afraid of me or keep me at arm‚Äôs distance. I feel as though I am a damaged person, with depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and deep sadness. Because of this, people find it hard to be around me and to relate to me. It‚Äôs a cycle that causes my pain to deepen.
These past few months have been difficult for me. I try to focus on the good, but it‚Äôs really hard. I feel so alone and alienated. I wish I was dead. My boyfriend does not understand. He thinks depression is something more like sadness, like I will be okay if he can make me smile. He means well and is all that keeps me going some days. But unfortunately he lives an hour away, and we work conflicting schedules, so I only see him two days a week. Even so, I think so fondly of him, but I know that deep down he is not doing much to help my emptiness. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs his responsibility or mine anyways.

I feel existentially lonely, knowing I will never fully experience another person, and they will never experience me. That I will live and die alone. I see people on facebook with friends, making music and art, touring the world, cooking and sleeping with a group of people that love them, and I just long for a life like that. I wish my life wasn‚Äôt so empty. I have no one to turn to for my bad days, and no one but my boyfriend for the good days.",5,"heart aches for a strong purpouse, a community, days are alone, long and empty,no one to talk to,, wish for someone to understand and relate to me, damaged person , depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder,deep sadness"

"Hi all,

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. 

I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way.

"So I was married for 8 years, got cheated on the whole time. I pretty much knew it but didn't do anything about it cuz how do you really make someone stop.

Then some how we got guardianship of another. But legally I think I'm only reasonable for the 1. I dunno. 

But anyway we have been separated for a few years now. I still live with her for the same reason. Still married to her unfortunately. Wish I had the money for the divorce. So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good.

"Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.

It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.",1,"friend severly depressed, borderline personlity disorder, abuses drugs, attempted suicide, snet suicide note, calls me shitty person, never been  there for her, toxic friendship"
"I'm not really sure if this is the place to post this, but it shouldn't really matter as it truly upsets me anyways.

Honestly, I've got to be one of the unluckiest people ever. It's coming to be really stupid and upsetting how unlucky I am.

My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. 

Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut)

I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made.

But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø FML. 

I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. 

This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. 

Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. 

I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive.

I got depressed and I'm on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can't do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there'll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don't feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I'm so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I'm already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it's just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who's my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She's kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex's side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex's visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can't sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I'm starting to feel super sleepy as I'm typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I'm just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom's support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what's the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn't even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it's all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don't want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can't get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I'm the only one making money and I don't have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don't want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change. But I've been wishing for that since a long time and yet, here I am.

Thanks for reading.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It‚Äôs Fucked. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent‚Ä¶ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn‚Äôt know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics‚Ä¶ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let‚Äôs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let‚Äôs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I‚Äôm sure we don‚Äôt need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I‚Äôve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let‚Äôs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall‚Ä¶ ADHD‚Ä¶? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I‚Äôm doing homework. I‚Äôm talking to people. I‚Äôm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well‚Ä¶ when I can‚Ä¶ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It‚Äôs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall‚Ä¶ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be‚Ä¶ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I‚Äôm not really happy me because happy me isn‚Äôt sad half of the day. 

I‚Äôm cheating depression. It‚Äôs always there and I don‚Äôt give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn‚Äôt respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

Dude. It‚Äôs fucked. ",3,"sinus , vomiting, saw gastroenterologist, allrgists, lost friends"

_________________________________

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

I tell people no to hanging out constantly because I can't get out of bed, I work as much overtime as possible to avoid real interaction and I mask it with determination but as soon as friends do something without inviting me I'm heartbroken. I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in. Right before my eyes it creeped into a crippling depression, but I can't even place when it got this bad. I get happy for moments and my mind quickly tells me it won't last and puts me back in my place I don't feel like anyone close to me fully understands. Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep.

I have depression so that doesn't help. My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work 

I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought

I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them.  Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me 

It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless

I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. 

I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them

"I swore 2016 wouldn't be another 2015 and then it all fell apart. I got incredibly depressed around March and suffered a breakdown and dropped out of school. 

I haven't finished a semester of college since December 2013 even though I've enrolled in classes several times since. I had a couple opportunities to get a job but in my usual fashion I totally blew it (caught the flu when I was supposed to go in for an interview).

I'm 21 and am doing nothing with my life. I know I'm young but at this rate I'll just be living with my mom until I die. I don't know how to fix this. This is the worst.

My health has deteriorated as well. I've gained about 50 pounds and have a poor diet in general. I always feel like shit. I know the solution is to just stop eating so much but it's hard when food is the only thing that makes you feel good.",2,"suffered mental break down, dropped out of school"

"(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)

I just want my life to feel worth living honestly. 

I'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.

I just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.

On average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. 

I lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that ""Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!"" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.

Everyone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always ""well he's just taking some time off right now."" Or ""yeah he's unemployed."" Or ""He doesn't really do anything."" Or worst of all ""Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography."" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as ""summer lifeguard"" and ""photographer"".

Stress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.

And don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!

I thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. 

I'm tired of people lying to me and saying ""You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!"" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.

Everyday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.

To top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a ""get over it"" kind of response.",2,"graduated high school, did not go to college, started with business, wonedring if imade worng choices, parents emapthy for unemployed graduate,consider photograpgy craft is a waste"

"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout.

Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it,  thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds.   Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression.

I take a shower, and don‚Äôt want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. I‚Äôm tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isn‚Äôt the problem making me depressed, it‚Äôs my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though I‚Äôm fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesn‚Äôt matter, but the majority of the day it‚Äôs all I think about. I‚Äôve become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong ‚Äì making me ugly.

 As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I can‚Äôt help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me I‚Äôm not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesn‚Äôt go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isn‚Äôt covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesn‚Äôt have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. It‚Äôs a burden and it‚Äôs annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don't want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesn‚Äôt hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesn‚Äôt let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I don‚Äôt deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and I‚Äôm so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. 

I know people say it doesn‚Äôt define you, but I‚Äôm letting it define me. I know people they don‚Äôt care about it, but they have to. It‚Äôs become severe, and I can‚Äôt do anything currently to stop it. I‚Äôve sunken into a deeper depression every day, I‚Äôm having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know it‚Äôs something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though I‚Äôve tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I don‚Äôt know if the birth control I‚Äôve been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but I‚Äôve had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. I‚Äôve been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. I‚Äôm happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started. I can‚Äôt take this anymore, every day I feel closer and closer to the ledge.. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cry about this all day and night and think about it 24/7. It‚Äôs driving me insane. I‚Äôve tried to distract myself, but I‚Äôve had a hard time doing that lately. 

I wasn't sure what sub to post this on. I guess I just needed to say something to anyone.

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics.  Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.  I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.  If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.  I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better.  Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",4,"mother's mental health deterioarted drastically, afther quit paying for health insurance, really struggleing"

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. 

One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self.

I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.

"The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making. Every single time I have hoped for the best, or looked forward to the future, it has been taken away without any real reasons and denied. This is not me.

"Hi guys,

Just needed to vent a little, and maybe ask for advice. I've been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements. Backstory, I graduated university this year with a graphic design degree and this job is supposed to be a stop gap to save up some money to move to a different city with better job prospects as there are literally 0 design jobs in my city. 

Essentially I'm sick of working crappy shift patterns, having no life outside of work due to travel times and being verbally bullied all day by customers calling up. Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a 'piss poor job' - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn't actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I'm doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can't shake it. I'm royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I'm waking up and I'm nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I've been in years.

Also, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I'm supposed to look for something else if I'm unable to start for another month. 

I really have no idea what to do. Anyone got any tips for a situation like this? The company and people are great but the job role itself is severely affecting my mental health and I know I have to put that first but I don't know how to do that.

Getting a response back while I was in the car on my way to seeing relatives I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to seeing made me smile and feel for a brief moment like I‚Äôm a normal person who could have those things.

"Since ""obviously"" we depressed people are just ""helpless souls"" who need to be ""saved"" by the ""normal people"".

They say ""just be happy"", GOLLY GEE you think I haven't fucking thought of that yet?

Sometimes depressed people don't want help. Of course, help is absolutely necessary sometimes, but quite frankly it's none of your business to come into our spaces and tell us how we have to act or what we have to say. If you have depression sometimes you need a place to just rant. 

It's nobody's obligation here to ""solve depression"". The point isn't to ""save"" depressed people. This is not the place for non-depressed people to try to ""save us"" and feel good about themselves in the process. This is a place where people who are trapped in suffering get to scream into their pillows and maybe have someone there who hears them and understands them and maybe even responds to them.

"And how utterly afraid I am. I suck at college. I am absolutely terrible at it. I just cannot seem to pull my head out of my ass when it counts. I am so unmotivated, not to mention tired. So damn tired. All the time. 

A lot of my worth is based on grades. When I was in school I would push myself too hard. After my anorexia calmed down a bit, so did my motivation to do schoolwork. Or anything. Without my eating disorder.

Ever since my eating disorder has been ""cured"" (and by that I mean calmed down to point where it's manageable enough that I don't have the constant need for exercise or racing thoughts over food and such) it's also had another impact: My motivation. I've noticed this ever since my anorexia really left me, my motivation is shot. I can't do college not because I don't have the mind or the resources but because I am simply not motivated enough to do anything. Before this, my anorexia and school work were tied together tightly and when I was in my funk but not so malnourished to function, my productivity would soar because it made me perfectionistic. Now, with that gone, I just can't find that motivation anymore.

But it doesn't just stop at school work. I am so tired lately. So incredibly tired. When I had my eating disorder I felt like I could lift mountains (until the wall hit of course) but now it's all I can do not to be asleep all of the time. It's why I don't go out much. Just getting out of my bed is harder than you can imagine. All I seem to ever want to do is sleep. I wake up and for and hour I'm all good, but after that it's a nap. And then 2 hours of wake and then I sleep the rest of the night. Luckily I don't have nightmares as I nap, only when I go for the long haul.

With the death of my anorexia (and to my shame I admit to trying to revive it several times) I have also lost my motivation and my spark it seems. Maybe it was because the only thing holding the haunting thoughts of trauma was my anorexia, and without that they are just free to take root in my mind and they very much do. The world is a much darker place. At least my anroexia had some sort of spark to it, as dark that flame was. Now I don't even have that.

Everything is just dark now. I have no motivation. No will. The only thing I seem to be able to bring myself to do is nap to avoid my pain. I'm honestly not sure what to do. I killed a enemy only to find it was merely the tail of a larger and more poisonous snake. 

Imagine seeing everything in back and white. That's pretty much how I see the world now. No more colors, no more fun shades. Just black and white. I'm more depressed now than I've ever been and no one is the wiser. I am so good at hiding it that no one sees anymore.",3,"eating disorder, anaorexia, lack of motivation, just want to sleep"

"All I hear all the time is that ""I'm lazy"" and that ""I don't care about my family"". I'm honestly not sure so I figured here would be a good place to post and try to possibly see what is going on with me at this current moment.

I've been struggling the past year with getting motivation to do anything. It has just slowly been getting worse and worse. It's to the point where I don't even want to get out of bed most days. Maybe I need an environment change or something? I have no idea.
I also find myself struggling to communicate with people and get peeved over the littlest of things. For example my parents are always telling me to clean but then they pile of bunch of things into my room or my sisters room to ""clean"" out the other rooms. All this does is make me frustrated because my mom later comes in saying my room is a mess and that I'm filthy even though I'm not even the one moving anything because I've been in bed all day.
No matter how much sleep I get I always feel tired and leads me to never want to do anything or have the energy rather to do anything. I do have insomnia and on school nights I would only get about 1-4 hours of sleep depending, but at the current moment on break I'm going to bed around 8am-noon and just sleeping until I absolutely have to get up. Even still I know I'm sleeping way too much but it to me feels like it's just because I don't sleep much during the school year.
During school I typically would only eat 1 meal a day, 2 on occasion, but now it's to the point of me not even wanting to eat full meals. It would be maybe half of a slice of pizza or a bowl of cereal and that would be it + 1 bottle of water for the whole day, then I go right back to sleeping or go on the computer and watch twitch streams.
I am in pain a lot. It's usually either one of my legs or I have headaches, but I'm used to having headaches almost everyday. I also don't like talking about how I feel so I tend to keep to myself, but as of recently I have kind of just been locking myself away in my room and staying on my bed.

I honestly have no idea if I truly could be depressed and should somehow convince my parents to set up an appointment for me or if I'm just lazy. Or if I should just go to the doctor on my own since I'll be 19 this month and could technically drive myself there. I just would have to get the bill sent to my parents so either way they'd find out. The only times I actually feel like doing anything is if I'm able to force myself out of my house. I don't know if it's something that I should actually get checked or if my parents are actually right and I'm just downright lazy. Also, sorry for any grammatical errors I don't feel like reading through it and fixing anything atm lol.

"Man lets see some of my highlights: 

-Started the year of doing lines of yack and smoking weed with people I thought would be my life long friends and overall brothers after all we had done and shared together.

-Met a beautiful girl online who I fell in love with. She was a first for me. Had a great amazing relationship at first but eventually our differences became too great and my depression mixed with her whole nonesense and bs kinda led to our on and off thing and us ultimately breaking up in september for good. I was devastated and depressed as fuck for a long time. For some reason checked her ig a while back and saw she moved on fairly quick and she's happier which kind of kills me inside a bit but overall at this point I'm happy for her and hope she finds what she's looking for.

-Almost didn't graduate cause I was too caught up in slacking off doing drugs and bumming out with ""friends"". But after a shit ton of detention (a grand total of 149 hours lol) I managed to get my shit together. My teacher Mrs. Nelson cried because of my actions and ultimately made me take school more seriously at the end and may just be the reason I graduated, Thank you Mrs. Nelson and I'm sorry i let my issues prevent us from having a really good relationship.

-Got sued cause of a stupid accident by a scam artist, but my insurance company handled it so I guess it wasn't to bad just really stressful.

-Tried killing myself a few times. One time I emptied a tank of gas on myself and almost lit myself on fire but the cops came and I was taken away to a psych ward. Met some crazy motherfuckers there but learned alot about myself. Once I got out of that place I needed a job after quiting my last one so I started pushing. That lasted a short while before I got my act together.

-Started college and went for a month before dropping out. 

-Got arrested after my dad called the cops on me after I hit a wall with some plyers lol. He stretched the truth a shit ton Got charged with felonies and now I'm facing jail time. Been going to anger management and rehab and now I'm starting to face and handle issues better than I would in years past. 

-I was homeless for a while. This taught me the importance of money, homes, and life. Being out in 20 degree weather without much to your name can make you want to bust your ass off harder than you ever could have thought imaginable. 

-Tried to jump off a bridge a few weeks after my arrest. Got stopped by the cops. I was drunk and called my friends because Idk i wasn't good mentally. I was tired, sad, depressed and just overall unable to continue with life at the point I was in life. Lost alot if not all of my friends at the time. About 80 percent of them actually. We still say hello and talk from time to time but its not like it used to be. Can't say I blame them. 

Now moving into 2017 I just want to get back to living a life of normal day to day monotony with its perks here and there.

My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. 

I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly.

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind.

No matter how hard I try, everything turns out wrong. I leave home at 7:40 AM and comeback home at 1:00 AM and during that time I study, study, and study. But my grades are not getting any better. I started dozing off everywhere, whenever since 2014 and it is not getting any better. I punched my thighs so hard during classes to keep myself awake and since then there are always bruises all over my thighs.

I think my depression started because I was lacking of affection. MY mother always wanted more and I couldn't give her what she wanted. She never encouraged me but scolded me because she thought I was not trying my best. She wanted me to be awake until 12:AM so I study like every other sons and daughters of my mother's friend but I couldn't. So I had to stand up and study in front of my mother. At school I took depression test (My middle school made me do that every year) and obviously my test's result said I have very low self esteem and I am suffering from depression. My mother found the paper and asked me about it and I could clearly see disgust in her eyes so I had to tell her I misread the questions.

I asked my friends for help at 2013 and my mother got so embarrassed about the fact I want to die so bad and I told others about that. And she screamed at me because I made her embarrassed. 

2014 I took depression test again and my teacher helped me a lot. He offered my mother to make me meet the counselor. My father disagreed, claiming everyone gets moody sometimes and I am acting like a baby. (But he never treated me like a baby nor child. I had to do everything by myself since my parents were busy taking care of my younger sister.) And my mother supported me for few months until my father told my mother it was a waste of money. I started to sleep a lot because I didn't wanted to anything and that's when I started to doze off.

My mother bought me liquid medicines that is good for my health (according to what she says) but I didn't want to drink them. So she grabbed my face and poured it into my mouth. She stopped doing that when I chocked on it and threw everything up.

I did cut myself few times and my mother was so embarrassed about my existence so I didn't have to go to church or big family meetings.

I also got bullied few times and my parents did not give a fuck. They claimed I was being to gloomy.

I don't have friends, I don't have any talent, my grades are getting lower, I hate myself so much and I don't even have courage to kill myself.

I am sick of my life.

"Had a session with my therapist before the beginning of New Year's Eve. I was trying to explain to her my greatest fear. The fear of never being understood. I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my ""illness"", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that ""things will get better"". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, ""please don't hurt yourself"". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?",5,"fear of never being understood,stern as emotionless being,hollow wound "
"I have been trying for a long time. I dont know if I can ever get over the things that have happened to me in my life or if I can ever be happy. I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?  When can I rest?",1,"PTSD,  anxiety, depression, dependent on someone who abused me"
"I'm glad to have found this page for broken souls. Like most of you, I have no one to talk to either. I certainly have no friends and haven't for a very long time, but I do have a family that loves me and even a wife. But I can't talk to them. See, my family doesn't understand the depths of my depression and I certainly can't explain it. Words fall short, tears choke out the ones I do try. No one knows me. My wife does, better than anyone else, but no one really knows. She's asleep on the couch right now cause we had another fight. 

My depression has been extremely severe for the last year, and the past couple months it has really been spiraling beyond my control. My anger and irritability are off the charts. I can't eat, but I'm starving. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I feel like every moment of my life is just spent suffering, waiting and wondering when it will all finally end. I just keep praying I'll die in an accident so I can be at peace without having to feel guilty for hurting the people who love me. I never leave my house anymore, I can't go into grocery stores or gas stations because I can't bare to interact with people. I can't work because the depression is so debilitating. Ive started having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety. I feel like no one likes me and I don't blame them. I hate myself, I hate having this severe depression, I hate what it does to me and the people I care for, I hate that it makes me useless. I would give anything to just be normal. I want to function like a normal person who can shower and go get groceries and talk to people and feel ok and work and contribute something. 

Everyday I wake up, I sit in my house all alone all day long staring at the walls and trapped in my own head, then I try to sleep again. I don't want to even move. It's gotten so bad and I'm so afraid of finally killing myself that I went to the doctor a few weeks ago even though I have no money, job or insurance. They did an MRI of my brain with and without contrast on the 28th and I am waiting for the results. I feel that I must have a brain tumor or something. I'm scared of how I feel and I am losing more control everyday. 

I'm almost 28 years old, I have 2 college degrees, a loving wife, a house, food, family...I had a good life for the most part, I mean it could have been a lot worse and honestly, situationally my life is better than it's ever been before. That's why I don't understand why my depression has gotten so bad right now. I've been depressed officially since I was 17 but the first time I tried to kill myself I was in the third grade. I don't want to kill myself anymore, although I fantasize about dying constantly. I'm not selfish enough. That's why I really want some help, I've lost control several times recently and all it takes is a few seconds to end your whole life. I don't want to do that. But no one understands where I am at right now, not even my wife and we have been pushing each other away for months.

I recently tried to battle my loneliness and for several months I tried making new friends and reaching out to old ones that I had lost. I kept it up daily even though it was exhausting for me. I never even once got the slightest indication any one of them cared or wanted to be friends or even liked me at all. It sucked and it hurt and it made me retreat farther. I used to be popular in high school and have tons of friends, I dont know what is so unlike able about me now. I guess I am awkward and don't have much in common with most people.


So.....what am I supposed to do? I just want to be better. 

My next step I think is going to be writing to this sub Reddit regularly. I need some place to get my thoughts out and to say how I feel, even if no one is really listening.

My boyfriend and his family and some friends sat around the dinner table on New Years Eve and we talked about our New Years resolutions. When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017. None of us thought I'd even be here to see this one. Everyone went quiet and looked away. One of the friends put his hand on my shoulder and encouraged me saying he was proud.

 I lied to my father the other day; he called me a ""fuckface"" and a""piece of shit."" He constantly reminds me of how lazy and spoiled I am, I never live up to his expectations. He always ends up shouting and swearing at me.
Water has always been a big part of my life, performing well in a recent meet brought me a feeling of elation I hadn't felt in a long time. I am lifeguard certified and teach kids how to swim.

"In 2016 these events took place for me: husband left me for one of my best friends, cancer scare, hysterectomy to prevent cancer, betrayed by friends who knew about the affair, soon to be ex has my 3 and 5y/o half the time now, raped. Just a week or 2 ago I started feeling very aggravated with people who were struggling with life. I'd compare their problems to mine and think ""everyone is so weak Try living my life"" Now, my whole life I've been the most sensitive person I've ever met. I always felt proud of my unconditional, tireless compassion. But, my whole life I've always gotten my feelings hurt so easily and I spent wayyy to much time people pleasing and trying to get everyone to like me. As I said, lately I feel nothing for the less fortunate. If I notice say, someone being nasty at work to me, I observe it but give it zero other thoughts. I've been dating and I have no intentions for anything but sex. I have no close or bonding feelings with these men. So I actually like this feeling of self-reliance. To not be such a people pleaser has made my life a lot easier. What gets me nervous is my impulsiveness. I keep doing things to see if I'll get caught, or hurt or arrested. Like, I'm a waitress and a customer was slightly snappy with me. No big deal. I decided to spit in his drink so if he continued to be rude I could have a good laugh about it. 2 men I've slept with have girlfriends and to this day we still text/hookup and I could care less for the girl whose relationship I'm invading. I don't even try to rationalize this behavior. I just have no concern whatsoever about how others feel. I drive very fast, all the time. Recklessly and aggressively too. If I think I can definitely get away with it I'll steal and feel nothing, no guilt. If you read this and can't get past the ""sleeeping with taken men"" or are horrified I'd spit in food, I already know it's despicable, I just don't care. If you wanna reply with some useful insight or personal experience with this please go right ahead. If you wanna just bash my shitty actions go right ahead too. I'm just seriously wondering if anyone's ever become temporarily sociopathic and will my concern for others come back? I don't want them too. It's very fun doing whatever I want.

"This might end up sounding like a bunch of rambling but I am tired and have to get this off my chest to someone else. 

The last few months have been really rough. Between a very serious likelihood that I am going to have to drop out of grad school because of a stupid error on my part, money issues, and just struggling with Seasonal Affect Disorder, this is the lowest I have ever been. . 

Getting the ""blues"" during the winter time for me is normal and I usually don't say anything to anyone but this year has been so so bad. Up until now, I haven't seriously felt the ""Things would be better without me"" feeling before and it scared the shit out of. I was driving in car and I had a very real moment of not wanting to hit the brakes as I pulled up to the stop sign.. I am still scared about how bad I was feeling and could feel again. Honestly, on top of the fear and sadness, I feel a lot of shame for being so bummed out and having a thought like that. 

I struggled with whether or not to tell anyone. I was really ashamed with how I felt. I have a degree in Psych and I work in Mental Health so I have given the ""who to talk to/numbers to call"" speech more times than I can count but I was/am scared to admit that I might need it. It took me a couple of days but I did end up telling my boyfriend. I don't think that I can talk to my parents/family about how I am feeling yet. .Just a different type of relationship with them but I told him. It was incredibly scary and I don't think I have ever felt more ashamed/scared to say something in my life. I couldn't outright say that I wanted to die in that moment but I told him how I felt and he seemed to understand. He made sure to do the good boyfriend/person thing. . Was very understanding/supportive but made sure that I knew I needed to tell him or someone if I was that sad or felt that way again. 

I am not saying that saying something made the depression any less or easier but i can say that telling him was a lot more freeing than I thought.

"Well first off 2016 has actually been the worst year of my life, and not because of celebrity deaths (Although Bowie was my idol). To star off the year my special needs aunt who was only one year younger then I (I am 22) died of breathing compilations due to chronic pneumonia. She had the brain functionality of a six month old baby, but we all loved her and we knew it would happen sooner or later.
Then not long after that I had to quit my job, drop everything and use all of my savings to go help my mother because she has a bad heart and it has only been getting worse. At that point in time she was in the hospital and they didn't think she would last the month. She ended up OK and is still around. I really didn't want to go because for my entire life she has been an alcoholic and a drug addict, and how she got her heart condition is an overdose of meth that blew up her heart. Thankfully she has pretty much given up the meth.
I was living with her for about four months all of the while being belittled and degraded by her boyfriend who stole money from me all of the time despite the fact that it was me paying for everything. Her friends weren't much better. Eventually I had enough and I moved back here to to live with my grandparents as they needed help because my grandfather had a stroke and later became for the most part paradise. 
That was the next part of this year that destroyed me. My grandfather due to the strokes and a few other things ended up getting dementia and it got so bad that eventually there was nothing left of him. For most of my life he was the only father figure because my parents were terrible people. He died in his sleep in October. It was also around this time my battle with depression (something I have had a problem with my entire life) started to get much worse and I started to make plans to kill myself.
I only have a few friends and because I was having problems and was distant at times they all started to push me out of their lives until I pretty much begged to be let back in. These are still the people I hang out with, thankfully it has gotten better with them. At the same time my boyfriend (I am bisexual if that matters) dumped me because of my depression. We were planning on moving in together and I was going to propose.
I am writing this because I can't sleep or I don't want to sleep because tomorrow is my eighteen year old and four month pregnant sisters funeral. She was killed Christmas day at six in the morning trying to get to our grandparents house for Christmas. She was hit by a car and was dead on impact. She was the only person I could ever %100 trust with anything, and I am afraid my mother and grandmother are next to go and I don't think it will be much longer because of their health.

Summary: Aunt 21, grandpa 70, pregnant sister 18 died and I am afraid my mother and grandma are next because of health problems. Ex Boyfriend (I'm bi) I was going to propose to dumped me because of my depression. I was used by everyone I thought I could trust, and I tried to kill myself a couple times.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I truly don't know how much more I can handle. I have to be the pillar of strength for my family and I have been for all of this because I hide how much I am hurting. I just wish it would all end and honestly the only reason I haven't been able to kill myself yet is because I am terrified of death. I am 22 6'5 and all I want rite now is someone to hold me so I can finally break down and cry.",4,"aunt, grandfather and sister died due to health conditions and accident, mother had a heart condition, alcoholic"

"April 2015. My sister took her life. 

It's been almost 2 years and I sought help a little after she passed. I fooled everyone, including myself, that I was slowly but surely getting better. Truth is, I just kept it locked away, like I always do. Recent events in my life have opened up some wounds, and I'm realizing the depression I felt 10 years ago in high school is still there. Feelings of being a failure, feelings of letting people down, feelings of not wanting to live are resurfacing. I'm not saying I want to take my life, but I don't want to live. Suicide would be cruel to my loved ones because they would have to deal with that twice. But if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I feel like that would be the best from everyone. I'm a miserable person, I'm selfish and I'm toxic. But I'm charismatic and I've hidden all this away for so long so no one knows my true pain.

The truth is, I basically killed my sister. I know that's what many family survivors of suicide say, but I knew my sister had some troubles. She was sad, she had been caught cutting and making suicidal threats for the past couple of years. And yet, I chose to ignore the warning signs because ""If I could get through it, she could."" My dad and her got into an argument one night, and I didn't help her. I even said aloud to my brother, ""She's going to kill herself one day."" A month later, she did. If I wasn't so selfish, I would have helped her, but I just wanted to get on with my life. I'm seeing now, all I bring people is pain. I'm venom. But since I'm friendly and well-liked people still gravitate toward my toxic orbit. The sooner I die, the better off the world will be.

"Hello I'm new here, I signed up in hopes to vent my feelings. Christmas has bought up a hole new wave of depression. Last year (2016) I lost my best friend 
, he was the sort of guy who I could talk to about this stuff. My bestfriend used this site daily so I thought  I may also find comfort in it.
What keeps playing on repete in my head, my daily  thinking is my best friend.
I wonder what happened to him on the day I lost him, what was he feeling?why didn't he call Me?
He always said he didn't want a dramatic death but jumping off a popular suicide spot in the south East of England seems pretty dam dramatic.
Did it hurt I ask myself? Was it quick, or did  the sea catch him and hold him hostage, like a rag doll he would have been thrown around and smashed up against the rocks. Did he think of me? 
Was he high?drunk?....IDK
Just why didn't he call me or leave a sign, just a week earlier he told me how I was his soul mate, and I  believed every word. He said how we would get a house together when we are 30 and still failing at life. 
I wish I could talk to him, hug him,hold him, smell him.  We were planning  on meeting up for a weekend, we hadnt seen eachother in 4 years...we stl called most night but life had just taken us to seprate ends of the country in different directions. If I didnt leave home at 16 to move further away would he still be here?
I know none can answer these questions but the pain crushed me and I just need to get my feelings out, perhaps one day I will look back at this and it will hurt less or not at all.
I have a tattoo for him, the delta actually. It ment change, I have no idear why I got it but at the time I wanted apart of him on me. Change? Why didn't it work why couldn't he use his tattoo and that way he would still be here. 
His mother told me he was drinking still excessively  and all he wanted was to be perfect for when he meets me again....but.i could have helped. I did not care I was his help why would he not trust that.

"Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

I (23yo female) have been together with my girlfriend (19yo) for almost 1.5 year now. We are very in love and very happy. She made me feel like I could finally breathe again.

I am too scared to confront her and ask her about this because I have always felt really insecure and she told me a couple of days ago that she is sick of me being insecure.. Which makes me even more insecure. Right now I have 2 weeks break from school to prepare myself for upcoming exams and one very very important resit.

The ability to wake up goto work get home spend 4 hours at most playing games and socializing then goto sleep and repeat?
The accumulation of stress and dissatisfaction renders that a logical life.. it would be irrational to put yourself in that state knowing you are literally digging your own grave.

Is it our choice if we live and work to live? No it isn't because if we choose otherwise we are treated with scorn and brainwashed into thinking we are ill or are the problem. we don't really make choices we just do what we are told like slaves.

Not really sure exactly what this is going to entail or what the goal here is, but I'm just going to explain my situation because I feel like telling someone will help me in the short term while things happen.

I'm a 25 year old male living in Vancouver, Canada. I'm basically a hikikomori if you know what that is, though not as bad these days. Roman Catholic mom(fairly devout), agnostic dad. 7 child family. Went to a catholic private school grades 1-7(and about half of 8 or so{I believe because of money}). I've always been fairly shy and introverted. I've had depression since I was about 13-14. It feels like manic depression, I can't be sure though because I've never seen anyone about it. Suicidal feelings from around 15-now. (not as bad now, but still scary sometimes)

I had lived in a fairly small town from when I was 6 to about 12, when my family had to move due to my dad being laid off. We never had much money. I'd had some decent friends and a pretty normal life there. I was happy. I went to 4 seperate schools(including a small stint of home schooling) immediately after this through grades 8-9 due to moving around, and ended up going into a pretty good public high school near me. 

Due to my introverted tendencies, the constant changing social environment, and making some progress with relationships that were cut off when I had to move again I think I just stopped wanting to make relationships with people.

I stayed at that school from 9-12, didn't have any serious issues. Never made any real friends. People tended to like me if they talked to me at school, but I wouldn't want to deal with most of them outside of it at all. We only had 1 computer in the house at this point, and I spent as much time on it as I was allowed. Through my mom's love of lord of the rings and her discovery of irc and nerd chat rooms, I eventually came to play a game called guild wars, which is amazing and you should play it. Not 2 though.

Anyways, while playing this game I met a guy and eventually bonded with him over just general internet things and general philosophy kind of stuff. We became pretty good internet friends and he was my only real friend I felt I had from something like 15-19. He proceeds to get girlfriend and as a result he finds he wants to spend most of his time working on his life in their relationship. I grow sort of bitter towards him since then. We still talk but it's just bullshit and it makes me hate myself and him for not being honest I guess. bromances are hard.

I lived with my family up until july 2016, when I moved into a top floor rental suite with a brother and sister. They're both constantly going out/bringing people over and it's annoying for many reasons. I had to use my credit card to pay for rent for the first few months, and have a bit of debt as a result. I've never been good with job stress and just holding a job for long periods, but I'm currently working at a sorting/shipping warehouse. It's not bad but it doesn't pay all that much and it's been stressful lately, I've been considering just walking out and hoping to god welfare will accept me if I see a counsellor or something. I have a small amount of money saved that could almost pay off the debt and leave me with nothing if I use the tax return from this year, maybe. 

I've had other friendships and relationships of various levels of seriousness, all mostly around not serious and just bullshit, in the time since. Not really in the last few years because of what ends up happening with them though. Whenever it ends up becoming somewhat serious which usually ends up happening, someone(often myself) can't handle it and has to go.

Over time I've just become less and less interested in having any sort of relationship with people. They're all shit when you get down to it(I know this isn't really how it is, but it's how it feels, socially). I hate people. 

The resulting state of my mind is not good. I'm terrible lonely and constantly think of how it might feel to actually have someone that I could love. Every day I constantly feel like I should just kill myself as it doesn't really matter in the big picture, but I feel to guilty because i'd hurt too many people. So every day I'll say I wish I could kill myself today but I can't. I have nieces and nephews and a mom that would be devastated. I'm lucky to have a single person that I actually also met on guild wars, that I can still talk to seriously and consider a friend even though I'm not sure how close. I might be dead without him. 

It's just that in this new house, without my parents. Without that 1 close friend I'd had on the internet in high school. Without any meaningful relationship with a girl ever other than 1 or 2 botched online ones, I'm so fucking lonely.

Every day it gets more unbearably lonely. I've smoked pot since graduation, walking to a grad party some ""friends"" had some alcohol/pot, and had always been sort of pressuring me and I'd been turning them down. I decided it was grad party time and fuck it, I'd wanted to try drugs for a long time anyways. Pot is amazing and has helped me a lot, but relying on it in times when your depression gets this bad and you need to constantly smoke more and more, it starts to just make you feel worse after a while if you don't do anything else/figure something out. I'm cutting back and trying to do something about it but when you've been on the internet this long and hate people this much etc there's not much I want to do except have someone that I love and who loves me. Which I will never have because that person can't possibly exist, and I wouldn't meet them if they did, and they don't deserve to have this broken piece of shit tied to them if they did. 

What I hope for is that I'll end up leaving this job, getting on welfare, rent my own place somewhere cheap and start drawing/painting doing other stuff I've wanted to do.

I am fourteen years old.
About half a year ago I was in the worst possible part of my life
... until now I feel.
I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD, I was hospitalized for a few suicide attempts. 
Back then I used to feel horrible. I wanted to die.
When I was hospitalized I met this girl. I thought she was the most beautiful human being.
We talked one day, and I quickly found out, that she was the most beautiful human being inside and out.

Fast forward a few months.
We've been talking quite a lot, and I've gotten to know her.
I felt like she was losing interest in talking to me, if I would not start the conversation there wouldn't be a conversation at all, and so I decided to ask her out. We went to the city and just walked and talked for three hours. It was the best day of my life. She seemed so glad to see me, and I felt like she had a really good time.
The next day it went back to normal, she doesn't really answer me, if I talk to her.
I'm so scared, that she has completely lost interest in me and my existence, and I'm not sure what to do...",4,"depression, anxiety, suicide attempt, liked a girl, asked her out, went to city, best day of life, dosent anwer"

So for that past two years I think I've been depressed, I've had to deal with a lot of losses. 
I thought and truly believed I was just 'tired' someone mentioned that I have zero motivation and zero interest in anything any more. 
I used to be the type that would rant and rave about the latest book, I couldn't tell you the last time I had an interest in a book. 

I work full time, come home and go to bed. I don't eat, I barley have a conversation with my family anymore and have 1 friend who I see once or twice a month. Other then that I lay in bed, in the dark and cry. 

I'm ready to get help, I don't want another year to pass me by, I want my old self back. 

Can anyone help with how I can speak to my doctor  to about this, how do I open up? I've never actually said these things out loud as I have no one to speak to

"Hi.
So, um... I'll just write shit down how it is in my head. I've had a lot of bad things happen to me and when I've sought help to deal with mental issues I've been told that in cases such as mine most people have either committed suicide, on heavy drugs or are in prison. I'll admit I've had my moments and I've done some crazy shit since I've been around 5 or 6 and I'm now 30. I am now on a heavy dose of antidepressants which I have realised does not stop you feeling depressed but helps you deal and manage it. It has definitely helped with my anxiety though. I've kind of thought that because I'm such an odd character and quite misunderstood that I would start finding ways to help myself and I've done this by excessively focusing on certain things. I've focussed on fitness and weight lifting I also enjoy gaming and streaming which has also helped with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong, there are days I wish I could clean the whole fucking house and not lay in bed wanting to destroy myself... they're are days where my mind and focus is a bit off and sometimes even way off but I can say these days it's a lot better than it used to be. It used to be waking up not knowing whether or not I was going to die or other people around were going to feel safe. Having been getting better with my anxiety I have now made new friends, talking does not bother me and I'm more relaxed I've even flirted with a girl which was nice. I do have another issue I would love to fix, I have a stutter which I've pretty much had forever. But you know what, I don't even care at all. Fuck it.
My advice to people in that state where they just want to die is, well think about this you're going to die eventually so may as well wait until it happens naturally or I guess unexpectedly. I know what you're saying, the pain of living is too much. I know. I've been through in order of age and events: hallucinations and hearing things along with nightmares from age 2 until about 11 then I was sexually abused, beaten by a drunk father almost weekly and I was bullied pretty much every day of my life until I finished school. My mother was abusive, her boyfriend was abusive, I lost my sister to mental illness she's not dead just lost. My son died (dog) I lost my job then my girlfriend of 9 years then my house then my mind my souls and my humanity. Getting everything back to stable was hard. I tried killing myself many times, well I planned it many times and I don't know how I never actually did it. My girlfriend at the time was also pushing me and provoking me knowing I was trying to kill myself. I can go into a lot more detail but it's a long story and there are many other shitty things I've gone through but you know what. Here I am! I'm alive and I've been through that and more so I feel that I win!! I conquered all that and I still smile, I laugh and I enjoy things. We're all bigger and better than the things that have hurt us, talk about things so that you can show it that it doesn't own you, that it doesn't hurt you and that it has no power! All the things you're afraid to do, do it! Unless it's kill yourself don't do that because you, each and everyone of you deserves to live no matter what you've done and what mistakes you've made! This is life and no one gets out alive so live it up and love!

"I'm used to going in and out of depressive episodes. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in my early teens. During some depressive episodes these thoughts are very frequent, more than 100 fantasies/day.
The thing I've realized is that these thoughts aren't just connected to my depressive episodes. Right now I'm not having an episode, but even a minor frustration makes me think about eventually killing myself.

"Alright, here's the deal; I haven't slept in about twenty two hours and my mother is blaring the TV whilst my sisters are screaming, so I'll just say that this may end up being despicably sloppily written, and pathetically long. 

Okay, so now that that's out of the way, I'll get into what it is that brings me here.

In the summer of 2016 I met somebody who quite honestly, as cliched as it sounds, changed my life, and enlightened my soul with new experiences and knowledge and a love too deep, too overbearing for a lone human to take without an excruciating pain present in an almost constant cycle. 

Just saying, I'm a trans dude, in love with a dude, who also likes dudes (in fact, he was the one who helped me figure out my sexuality and supported me more than anyone else regarding my gender identity). Except he doesn't have romantic feelings towards me. Lovely, ain't it?

Anyway, ever since the very first phrases uttered to each other, there was a connection. Heck, I felt that connection when I first laid eyes upon him. No, I'm not talking about love at first sight, but I am certain there was an excitement, an understanding, you know? And I'm pretty sure he felt that connection too.

And that connection was ignited like a fire which fed off of the act of fooling, the act of making the sweet and the ripe believe it was eternal. Less poetically put, when he he started talking to me less and less, when his vibe held this sort of apathy, I was very much so disheartened and in complete disbelief. More accurately, I still am. 

And I blame myself. I blame myself because of my various mental illnesses, and my annoying, whiny and pathetic behaviour whilst he put so much, so so much into helping me out. He gave me advice, he stayed up all night to talk me out of suicide, he did everything in his power to convince me that I wasn't some useless loser. And he genuinely thought that. He genuinely cared. He genuinely thought I was an amazing human being. And frankly, if it weren't for him, there is a great chance that I'd be dead by now. Yes, okay, I've tried killing myself multiple times over the course of our friendship, however each and every time I failed, and holy hell was he glad I failed.

I mean, that's obviously not the only thing we spoke about. Of course not. We have everything in common. Jesus, we even have the same favourite colours. I am not religious or spiritual or whatever, but this? This guy, this friendship, it's simply too much of a miracle for it to be over now. Cause, you know, we've drifted apart (for the record, he knows I'm totally into him, but that isn't what changed things).

Honestly, I've never had friends‚Äîlike, seriously, I've never had real friends‚Äîbut this guy, and when somebody introduces you to something new like this? When somebody finally makes you feel like you matter? Yeah, that's pretty darn difficult to just let go of.

My problem is, we haven't really spoken about my ""issues"" in a while, and I'm seriously just one big mess. I tried to kill myself the other night, and though I don't think I plan on trying again any time soon, I am completely lost and I have no one. No one. Therapists and all that just don't work in my situation, and honestly, I just need him. As a friend. As someone who's there for me.

Except I don't want to annoy him. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to make him feel bad, and any harsh feelings he may have towards me? Yeah, I deserve that, and I accept all of it. But I just don't know what to do. Would I be a complete and utter idiot if I texted him?",3,"met somebody, changed my life,  trans dude, gender identity, drifted apart,  donít want to annoy"

"It started around 3 years ago. When strange things happen just to make my life worse. Even if it affects others. 

My relationship with my family isn't that great. We never do anything, my dad is just lazy and for the most part only wants to watch tv or YouTube. My mom has a neurological disorder that makes her sleep a lot. But now I believe that she's just being lazy as she has gotten better. I believe that if she change her sleeping routines and go to bed and get up at the same time every day she won't sleep as much. Then she can seek a new job and start working again. She worked as a teacher before. It's quite stressful so that could've been the reason her disorder worsened.

When it comes to friends I really does only have two. But one of them is a bit shy and for the most part only wants to play computer games. And the other one doesn't have so much time to hang out with friends. Anyway one strange phenomena was about 2 weeks ago when we had the opportunity to choose who we would want to learn a ""Just dance"" dance with. We could choose to be 2-4 people per group. I didn't really get into any group so then I asked my closest mates if I could be with them but they were already 4. So they said that i could go to the group with 3 people. But I didn't, it did not feel right. So next lesson we wrote down who were in which group. And we started arguing in which group I would be in. But the group with three refused to let me be with them for no reason. It's strange because I used to hang out a lot with two of them before. Many of my class mates was on my side and started to get angry and upset that they refused to have me in their group. But they had already decided, it was impossible to change their mind. Soon a mate that I've known for a long time who has always been supportive let me in his group. And now we were five in one group. The strangest thing of all is that the two mates who were in the group with three. We are still going home together as usual, joking around and just having fun.

Now in Christmas time my cousins have been here celebrating Christmas together. First my younger cousins were here and just as they were leaving my older cousins came. At first everything is great and all but then my cousin who is two years younger than me is starting to get annoying as he always do and questions everything you do that he think is strange. And when you try to argue with him about it he's too stubborn. So you cannot prove him wrong. But what is most annoying is when he always does as you don't want. He's 13 years old but behaves like a three year old who always do the opposite as you want. And the worst thing is that I can't just leave him. If he comes to visit me he will stay for a long time. 

At New Year's eve. We were left at home with our grandpa while my younger cousin who's 11, my and their parents went to a NYE feast at my parents friends house. Me and my cousin needed to cook food for the evening so we did. Afterward we went to the city to watch a firework show. When we went home again we saw that my younger cousin was at home so we asked what she did home and she answered that their mom got drunk and dizzy. It was unbelievable because she never drink so much alcohol. Later at the night my younger cousin wanted to watch Netflix on her brothers iPad but he didn't allow her as usual and they started fighting I don't know what's wrong with him but he has some kind of disease. The fight went down intensively until my grandpa shouted at them to be quiet. Their dad hadn't got home yet so they called him and said that he needed to get home  instantly. We waited about an hour but he didn't come. We called again, he explained that it was hard to get a taxi at that time. But just as we hung up their mom came down and was insanely angry she almost threw our iPads on the floor. We instantly ran upstairs to go to bed. The next day my younger cousin was upset about what happened last night and screamed that she was an idiot. She didn't get angry and realized her mistakes to drink so much. 

I don't know what to do anymore everything just seem so meaningless. It feels like I won't experience a great life because of all the bad things that happen to me. I hope that you can find  solutions for my problems.

I'm sorry if I didn't use the correct grammar. English is my second language and I'm writing this on my iPad.

Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it!

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. 

Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. 

All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? 
I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ?

"I wanted to hear some opinions on a decision that has been bothering me for the past few months. No one I've asked irl seems to want to tell me what they actually think, just telling me to decide on my own.

I'm a sophomore at university, and I've been severely depressed for about two years now. Over the last year, my depression has gotten worse and worse. This last month of school, I didn't go one morning without crying, I constantly just wanted to go home. For whatever reason, being at school, being at my apartment in my university town, is miserable for me. 

My counselor suggested that if I wanted, I could take this spring semester off with medical leave. 

I don't want to stop school. I know it wouldn't be a ""failure"" to take a medical break, but it sure feels like it. I can't even imagine a future in which I don't go back to school. I don't know what I would do with myself at home. Lounge around in my tiny town and work retail? I don't know if that would help me at all. 

On the other hand, this December was easily the worst month of my life. The last two weeks of school I had to fight every day to get up in the morning; just walking across campus without wanting to break down and cry was a struggle. I know university has become this negative space for me, and I guess it would make sense that I get away.

I don't want to leave school, despite all of this. School is the only thing I really have. I don't have any activities or friends. I go to school, go to the gym, do homework, and sleep. Once school is taken away from me, I will have nothing. Maybe it is a blank slate that I need? But maybe once this is taken away I truly will cease to be a functioning member of society. 

I'm scared that if I leave school, I won't find my momentum again, and I won't ever go back. But if I go back and it's anything like this December, I won't make it. 

I really don't know what to do.

How are you feeling today lovely humans? ,0,
"If you dont believe in Karma, you will after this story. This is a story of my year of how I lost everything that makes me happy. I have never been good around people... I mean awkward around others. I hate being this way, but society will not let me change. I try to but I always end up here... ALONE. I had it all until Jan. 2016. So like I implied before, I never had many friends in reality but I did online. I played Xbox a lot (too much) but it was where I was happy. I had an adequate amount of friends there, but I had taken it all for granted. I treated my friends on Xbox like shit. They were the best friends I had but pride consumed me. On one bad day, I had been informed we do not have unlimited internet anymore.This was devistating because the happiest moments of my life was here. This was in January when this had happened. I managed the best I could. This hurts me the worst because this ruined my dreams of being a gamer on Youtube. We still had internet but limited.
      So the month is now March, I have met a very beautiful girl, and I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to rush anything ( This was an excuse because I was scared). I tried to gain the courage to ask her out everyday. So lets skip to next month (April), I finally gained the courage and did it. The answer was maybe. I should have just given up there, But I was in denial. She manipulated me for a month until she said no. Life was living hell for awhile.
     So after I tried to get my life together, the month is now June. I was now going to pursue my Youtube dreams. I was blindly happy for awhile. I told myself me videos were good... looking back I lied to myself. With limited data means limited quality. The only subs I got was my friends. After about a month of regular posting, my videos got a little better. I was somewhat happy until I lost all of my friends on Xbox. I know I am the only geek who had best friends on Xbox but they were. I don't blame them. I treated them like shit.  After this I just lost all hope and care. I posted about 2 more videos then I lost all my motivation. I was truly ALONE.
     After this I started to learn more about programming. I love computers. The more I learned about programing, hacking, etc. the more alone I felt. Around this time school started so I couldnt program as much. I absolutely hate school. They say High School is the best years of your life, but I say Bullshit.
     So time passed and the time is December 2016. I still played games but not as much. They are the only thing that made me happy. I see it as alcoholics have boose and I have games. I was so alone that I played cs:go in offline mode. Cs:go took up too much data so I didnt want to play online. I felt invincible online at times when I was programming. One dark day my pc gets hacked. I lost over a years worth of code. Ironically at this time I was making a very strong firewall that was almost finished. The hackers stole the code for my firewall program. I had to get a new OS         (operating system). I lost my games too. I cant get them back either. I am left with nothing.
      This is the conclusion of this story. I am not going to commit suicide. I do feel numb and emotionless. I smile and laugh sometimes but it is just a mask of numbness. This is my story of 2016 and how all this contributed to my depression. I do have few friends outside in reality but I had really good friends online too. I am lost in life now. I do not have dreams anymore. I do not know what to do. I wrote this because I have been keeping this bottled up for the whole year. I take full responsibility for my actions and I think I deserve what has happened to me. Hell I treated my friends in reality like shit too.  I thank you for reading this.

"I don't know how much more I can take. I've been depressed for years, tried half a dozen kinds of medication, been in therapy for 6 months (tried multiple therapists) but it just doesn't work. Every time I think I'm making progress, I'm quickly reminded I'm wrong. 


I have no friends. Not real ones. I can't remember the last time one of them initiated contact with me, not on a normal friendship level. I'm everyone's sounding board. I listen to their problems, I offer sympathy and advice, and they go on their way. I have nobody to talk to about my problems because they've all go their own stuff. They wouldn't care anyway. I always have to make the effort and then get nothing back in return. My boyfriend says his friend like me, but that's only because I'm dating their friend. 


I know nobody 'deserves'  friends, but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I try so hard. I put in so much effort to be there for everyone whenever they need. I try to be fun and engaging and talk to people about their interests even though they never show an interest in mine. For example, I won a pretty big prize related to my hobby last month. Everyone knew about it, nobody cared. If my friend won an award, even in something I don't care about, I'd at least be happy for them and congratulate them. But no, nobody even pretended to care. 


I keep thinking if only I was more attractive, people would like me more. Attractive people have friends, right? If only I was smarter. I know I'm smart, but maybe that's not enough? Am I not funny enough? I travel a lot but make a conscious effort not to be obnoxious or pretentious about it. I don't post 200 selfies from my trips or anything like that. My hobby is slightly unique, but still something anyone should be able to relate to. I'm up for anything, I'm adventurous, I always put on a happy face. I just don't understand why my friends keep rejecting me. Whenever I try to make plans someone comes up with an excuse to bail. 


I've tried making new friends. I moved to a completely new city a couple of years ago to try and start fresh, but the cycle continues. 


A few years ago I was supposed to be my best friend's bridesmaid in her wedding. She demoted me from bridesmaid without telling me (I had to find out through Facebook) and then I wasn't even invited to the wedding. And I still don't know why. I've thought about it so many times and I can't think of a single reason for that to happen. She's still 'friendly' with me, so no, there was no fight we had, not even a mild disagreement. Literally nothing I can think of that would have caused that. 


Then a few weeks ago an out of town friend guilted me into letting her crash at my place even though my apartment is way too small and it would be a massive inconvenience. It was super short notice but I felt bad for her so said yes. She never responded to my reply, never showed up, haven't heard from her since. 


I wish I was just being intentionally obtuse but I... Just don't know why I drive everyone away. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it. 


It doesn't help that my mother has replaced me with my nephew. I understand she's excited about being a new grandma (15 months) and I love my nephew so much, but literally every single photo of me has been removed from her house and replaced with my nephew and sister. Not an exaggeration, all of them, even my baby photos. 
Again, I don't know why. My mum and I have a good relationship, hell we're away on holidays together right now! 


I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what more I can offer people. I don't need a best friend, I just want someone to like me. I'm very lucky to have my boyfriend, he's great, but it's unfair to place all my emotional needs on him. I just want a friend. But it's like I'm not meant to have one. 


I'm so unhappy and don't know what to do. I want to know what I'm doing wrong because I can't keep living like this. I'm on holidays so I should be happy but I can't stop crying in the bathroom. Maybe I'm just meant to be alone? But if that's the case, I'd rather be dead",5,"no real friends,  nobody deserves friends, mom relpaced me with my nephew,"
"Im at rock bottom and I don't know where else to go with this so here I am

I've been depressed for awile now and there were some events today that got out of control, my sister broke a drone that I got for Christmas and my mom did nothing I got pissed and threw the controller and stormed back to my room my mom's solution tell me I'm worthless and she's tired of my crap &amp; shove my dog outside (which is the only thing that gives me happiness) we were supposed to go to town and go see a movie (just me and my mom) but my sister tagged along so my mom said we would go to Starbucks and then go to the mall instead which really pissed me off to begin with.

Christmas break ends for my school we go back tomorrow and there is more stress there I've been so pressured to get good grade my mom wants me to go to insanely good schools (Stanford, Duke, Vanderbilt) to name a few and they are good schools for engineering but the stress of keeping grades up is insane I leave school with a headache and a tight chest every day I have to get all A's &amp; B's taking honors and AP classes and if I don't I get punished

I really have nobody else to go to because my sister hates me for god knows why my mom doesn't care I've tried telling her I need help or therapy or something she just blows it off and I can't go to my dad because he passed away when I was 7 years old I just have nowhere else to go and I think it will help to just get this off my chest

Thanks if you read my problems I hope it will help to get this off my chest im just gonna try and get through these next few weeks and try to improve I know these are petty and dumb things to complain about but there has been a ton of stuff building up to this thanks for reading it helps me know someone cares

"So I have rapid cycling bipolar 2 which is a less severe form of bipolar. Anyway, for the past few days I have been manic and it has been worse than it usually is for me. basically, what happened was I started snap chatting girls and complementing them and stuff.

"Hey everyone. Still horribly depressed here. Lately I've been lurking subreddits and searching the internet on ways to improve my situation (something I spend a lot of my time doing, likely to the point of counterproductivity), and I can't help but feel terrible after doing so. 
        
My main problems are things many of you are also probably familiar with; i'm depressed, have a rock-bottom self esteem, have suicidal thoughts, ect. The issue I have that trumps (and is likely the cause of) all the others is that I'm socially awkward and suffer from social anxiety. 

I have terrible social and emotional issues. Honestly, this makes me feel like I generally suck as a person, and mixed with depression, is objectively true.  Worst part is, I'm 21, an age where the vast majority of people have either already toppled these kind of issues in adolescence or were successful enough in being people that they never experienced them. But me? I'm fucking lost. Well, not lost necessarily, but hopeless? I know what I need to do to become confident, stable, likable, successful in my endeavors. Problem is, when I see how much work I have to put in to actually become a decent person, realize the sheer gravity of the change that has to take place for me to be the person I want to be and the literal year(s) it might take, I start to wonder if it's really worth it. 

I have no friends. Let me go a step further and say I have no real human connections.  This is not because of other people. It is because of me. Who I am fundamentally as a person, the result of my life and culmination of my personal reactions to my life's events. I have never been confident and social, and thus have never known what it's like to truly live. Twenty one years of never truly living is twenty one years wasted, and I don't know if I can go on. There are so, so many things about me that need fixing. I have to work relentlessly to reverse the damaged/incongruent person I've become. The thing is, most people don't have to worry about any of this shit. Even a lot of depressed people have friends, significant others, and get over their ailment with relative ease. Me? I can't even fucking have a conversation with someone. I don't know if I'll ever be the person I want to be, or grow to love the person I already am; It would take too much time and effort to do either. I'd rather just end my life now and save myself the pain.",5,"horribly depressed, looking internet to improve  situation, terrible social and emotional issues, have no friends, no real human connections"
"26, the only son of a proud Asian family, gay since birth. Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. 
The main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this ""love"" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.
It's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.
I still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text ""hey"" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K. It's that pathetic.",1," Asian , Gay, cannot come out, love guy friend, he moved abroad, got married, only person ever loved"
"I got a guitar for myself this Christmas. My family kind of ignored me this year for Christmas, but that's par for the course....Either ignore or belittle me, one or the other. Anyways. I started playing again. It was a random idea, honestly, a 'good day', where I passed the local music store and saw one in the window. I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay. I was a greek god for all I was concerned. He actually didn't recognize me, not that I don't blame him. I've gained a bit of weight and I have a bad habit of not taking care of my hair..After talking to him for a little while, and explaining the new idea, he said that he was actually here to sell his guitar. He said if I wanted it, it was mine, so long as I promised to play it pretty often. It's not new or a beauty, but it meant a lot, especially since I look like unmotivated scum.

Anyways. There's my hope for the day. I've been playing that.

Unhopeful. I've been hearing shit that other people can't hear? I can distinguish that it's not like...Real...But it sounds like someone is whispering in my ear. Like I can feel the tingling of breath sometimes on it? It's kind of freaking me out...I was wondering if it would make sense to bring it up to a doc or professional, or if they'd just lock me up...Particularly because sometimes it says really, really bad shit. Like right now it's telling me to kill myself.

"I am a male and am 16 years old, I took biology, chemistry, maths and philosophy for my A levels, and  I don't know what to do.

I had in mind that I would become a doctor, but then I read, that they have to mostly spend weekends working and work overtime.
That made me depressed. I thought I had it all figured but, then I realised that I don't really know anymore if I want to become a doctor.

I really don't know that much about myself, but I know that I can't be bothered to work over hours. I like to make songs, and sing, and edit videos, but I really don't know what career to take from those, especially since I have already started a level with those subjects.

"I don't really know where to start, because I literally do not understand myself, but I guess I just came here to see if anyone could make me feel a little better.

I have always been an anxious person, always one of those people who worries about the smallest things and blow it up in my head, and I have had bouts of depression but they seem to come and go. I think the problem lies in that I hid this well from my family having lived away for university for 4 years, and when I came home I felt so happy to be back with them, that they never saw me at my bad state.

I have been living at home since graduating, and all has been fine. But I feel I've completely fucked up christmas, having thrown a complete crazy on my family.

I arrived home from a trip to Slovenia with my boyfriend late on NYE - about 9:30pm. They'd waited for us to eat and mum had spent all night cooking. On the way home my phone broke, and for some reason it put me in a horrible mood - usually I'd relax about this but as soon as I came in the house my mum said to 'just chill out and leave it until tomorrow' and said 'it's because you treat these things badly' and for some reason it made me go CRAZY.

 I knew I hadn't treated the phone badly and for some reason i felt so angry that I wasn't allowed to be worried about it (because I worry about my family alot). But I completely overreacted, stormed upstairs crying and shouting about how much I care for them and how they don't care for me, and from then on the evening went MAD. They all ignored me which made me get worse, although from their perspective I probably looked a bitch so I get why, but it made me so mad so I started screaming and throwing things around (again, I have NO idea why I did this, I see RED when I get in these moods). My sister came up and tried to talk to me and said it 'wasn't worth crying over' which again made me mad and I was screaming and screaming about how they should care about my stuff too. She lost her shit then, slammed her door and went to bed. Then my Mum got really upset, packed a bag and went walking, saying she couldn't be around it (she has PTSD, and has struggled with it for ages). Dad followed her, they returned an hour or so later. When they returned, Dad came to speak to me, I confessed everything about my anxiety and bouts of depression and feeling sad sometimes, and that I was sorry. But then I heard my Mum and Sister whispering about me being annoying or something, and I saw red again. I stormed downstairs, started screaming and hitting myself in the head with scissors, and  screaming ""how come they don't give a fuck about me?"". Sister comes downstairs, grabs me by the scuff of my jumper, shouts ""if you don't fucking shut up I'll get you sectioned myself you're being pathetic"", slams me down on the sofa, so I slapped her in the face. I DO NOT hit anyone, never have, but I felt threatened by her and annoyed that she somehow just didn't feel at all supportive. But i get that it would have been a shock to her. She was pissed at me. Lots of crying on my part and we all went to bed. 

The morning came and everyone was so weird, although my Mum and Dad sat me down and said they would make me a doctors appointment. But I don't know if I need one? I have no idea why I reacted so badly, but 50% of the time I am completely happy. 50% of the time I worry like mad, constantly worrying about family dieing, or if they're happy, if my boyfriend is interested in someone else, if people like me, if I'm hated... alot.

But I have NEVER felt so bad now. I feel like I've destroyed the one thing I was certain on, my family. I feel like I've destroyed the happy, innocent view they had of me and I'm now seen as a crazy bitch. I feel like I ruined NYE and that was the last time we'll have together for a while, as my sister lives far away. I feel like I've just fucked up everything. I can't stop crying, I can't stop going over that night in my head, I'm not hungry, I feel hopeless, I feel like my family will never be the same.

And I know I am probably being irrational but I just feel so shit. I want everyone to be happy so badly and I feel I have hurt that, when they have other things to be worrying about and demanding jobs. Now they'll look back at NYE and hate me for it.

I know this is a really long story - sorry. But I feel completely alone and I want the tears to go away, because I feel very overwhelmed. I really wish I could go back to that night and act like a normal person, because if that was the case we'd all be sat around together watching a film and being happy, but we're not, and I miss that. It doesn't happen often anymore and I fucked it.

"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much.

I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand.

To summarize for you all: 

* They were involved in some deep stuff.
* Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head.
* The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
&gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed.

* They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment.

* Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly.

I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them.

i had very much given up on feelings for people. a series of indifferent relationships and unenjoyable things had left me cold. i thought something was wrong with me, perhaps, and that i could not love or feel in love, whatever that means.

(i should mention i've had depression for the longest time (i'm mid twenties now)).

then i meet this person. they are the best at talking, we share so much in common; music, conversation, sex... everything. they're beautiful. and a weight is off my mind, i feel different about everything. i think about them all the time. i am creative again and i have feelings and the world is colourful again.

the only problem is, i know that they have to leave forever, and that my feelings are logistically impossible... there's no way to continue seeing this person at all.

we had talked about it. and i understand rationally that stopping everything right now is the healthiest thing to do... before any feelings get too strong.

but i can't stop fucking thinking about what might have been given different circumstances, though. i am torn up. obviously i didn't tell them all this. they need to be happy! and its not fair to make them feel any worse than they do... i want them to do what's right for them!

but at the same time... i want to see them again. i want to message them. i want to say all these things and hold them and see them and kiss them again :(

"My life is a complete fucking mess. I don't know if this is depression, some undiagnosed mental thing, or just me being under the illusion I'm somehow special and need help even though my life is normal

I guess I've always felt some depression. I never really fitted in. I was always the most unpopular guy in school by a long margin and just kept myself under the illusion that I didn't give a fuck, I could sort my life out later and not worry about it. I have never had very many friends, if at all, in real life; and found myself turning online for people to talk to. I'm too fucking anxious to talk to people in real life. Over the past year or so I began speaking with a guy, my age, with similar problems to what I have now I suppose. We grew closer and closer, he told me he was transgender and wanted to become a girl. Cool, I'm totally ok with that, hey maybe I can support him during transition in the UK - he was in the US. Of course, it was kinda inevitable that since we were already so close we fell in love. I was 100% sure I was straight but it's the first time someone had ever shown love to me and I loved him so much, and we were determined to make it work. Over time we planned out our lives, I guess an escape from reality, and I felt I'd met my life partner. Over time though, I began feeling more and more shit. Some days I felt so damn in love nothing even mattered I was so happy and upbeat, some days I hated myself, didn't want to wake up, feeling empty. We broke up yesterday which, I'm not gonna lie, has contributed to this, but even before that, before then I felt bad, I was just trying to gloss over it. The breakup was on good terms and immediately after I felt relieved in a way. Now though everything is haunting me - thinking of anything we did together, listening to any music they suggested or even that I played while we were messaging causes me to literally burst into tears. I can't speak to them about anything without having an emotional breakdown. It's made me realize how alone I was, a reality check. It's made stuff worse but definitely hasn't caused it.

Right now I have one person I'd truly consider a friend in real life, and complete anxiety to speak to anyone else. I feel so damn lonely, this Christmas has been awful. I don't have many interests which makes it difficult, computing is probably my main and when anyone asks about that I honestly can't tell if they're being serious or just sarcastic. I used to trade stuff to make extra money but that became an obsession, buying and selling for even the tiniest profit, and now it all just seems pointless. I'm reckless with money, deep into savings parents lent me trying to ""start a business"" - ""I can easily repay them"". Nope, I'm thousands in debt already to a fucking emergency fund and I hate myself for being so naive into doing that. I've kinda lost my interest in everything now, everything seems pointless, and I'm just left browsing reddit pointlessly or watching youtube all day listening to the same repetitive music.

Even before then I had thoughts that I want to sleep and never ever wake up. That I hate living. Nothing truly suicidal - I could never face death, but mentally in a way - giving up, that everything was pointless. Sleeping is my only way to escape from the shitty thoughts I have, from anxiety in anything social.

Throughout the relationship I had what I called ""negative thoughts"" - what if I didn't love her, what if... etc. I put pieces together with something that has been going on throughout my life that I'm guessing is very mild ocd - pathetic things like triple checking the gas burners are off before bed, having to step on the same paving slab, type evenly on a keyboard - it's all very irrational and does not make sense but if I don't do it my mind says ""if you don't do it then so-and-so won't happen"". During the relationship this got bad as the thing I wanted most - the relationship - began to be the go-to for everything and I was literally double or triple checking everything, my mind insisting I did everything evenly. It's not happening as much now because there's nothing I want, inserting death into that situation has no effect.

These have also been complimented with always worrying about stuff, something I've had for a long time. Irrational fears. I can't tell which thoughts I have are real and which aren't. I've been worrying I'm gay, or I'm transgender, or I'm asexual, completely irrational since I've identified as straight cisgender all my life, and the thoughts will not fucking go away. I have so much anxiety speaking to girls it's making those arguments worse, and of course the relationship is like, even though I fell in love with her viewing her as a girl which she really is if he's transgender, ""you fell in love with her as a guy and of course that makes you gay"". I'm struggling to hold a conversation with friends for fear of going on or being judged, I can't even start a conversation with any girl about work or whatever.

Everything in life just seems pointless like there's no end, no point in working, no point in anything. I haven't done a single piece of homework, always excusing my way out of it. I can't concentrate for more than ten minutes. I have GCSE mocks in two days and I haven't revised at all - I just find myself getting distracted - then I cut internet and just fall into depression and crying uncontrollably. I'm gonna fail them, everyone is telling me I should be aiming for A*s but I'll be lucky to fucking pass them like this. We were meant to revise over Christmas and I've spent the majority of my time crying about self-pity, worries, loneliness in real life, regret, anxiousness, and lack of motivation; and then staying up until 4am to try make the mess that was a long-distance relationship work, not getting up until 2pm. It was fucking stupid, it's my fault, but I just keep putting shit off and once I do try to focus I give up. There's no fucking point.

I look awful, acne is covering my skin, I only started giving a proper fuck about personal hygiene properly as the relationship started so my acne is probably some of the worst ever, I can't see it ever going. (The only other treatment left that might work is this shit that has possible side effects like ""suicidal thoughts and depression"" and I worry shit like that is gonna push me over the edge). I'm stupidly tall, over 2m yet under 16yo, my body is a mess, I'm ugly as fuck and I can't ever see someone being attracted to me, ever. I'm awful at sport, I swim but have lost the motivation to because nothing seems to fucking matter anymore.

I don't even know why I made this post. It's a mess. I'm really hoping it's just getting over a relationship but seeing as this happened before it ended and in the past before I even spoke to this person I don't know. I just hate the fucking thoughts in my head telling me to do things, or irrational thoughts that I'm struggling to judge if they're even irrational anymore. I can't tell what's real and what's fucking with me. I can't concentrate on work, I can't hold a fucking conversation, there's nothing I'm good at, I'm the most unpopular guy ever and I'm worrying I'll never be able to get over this fucking mess I called a relationship let alone even initiate another one. Everything is pointless. My mood is constantly swinging between crying uncontrollably about everything, chucking everything on the floor, kicking shit with anger and self-hate, and then happiness and hope, rarely though. I started writing this post feeling awful, now I feel very slightly better, but I know I'm gonna feel worse in a bit.

I don't know. My life shouldn't be fucked up. This is probably just me being stupid and overhyping things like I always tend to do and I'm really fine but in the darkest times I know it's more than that. In the darkest times, every couple of days, I just want my life to end. Is it depression? I'm really not sure - I can't be sure on fucking anything it seems.

"As the title states I think my wife is depressed. She won't admit that she is though, nor will she see anyone about it. 

We used to see a counciler together, but stopped because she claimed it was making things worse.

The whole story:
In March of 2015 we had to move for me to start my career, she was pregnant and the baby was due in a week. Before this we lived an hour from her parents for college and she went to her parents every weekend to visit, even if i had to stay to work. My wife was going to stay with her mom since they lived closer to the Dr we had been going to.

I started the job and my son was born the next day after my wife got rushed the the ER. Very eventful, but great day. Wife turned out okay and have a healthy son. After a week we got to go to or apartment, which is around a 2 hour drive from her parents.

Fast forward a few months, she started missing family, we've also been driving up to stay at her moms place at least every other weekend. Then in November after a few weeks in the hospital her grandmother dies. This drives her over the edge the first time. She talks about how much she needs to live in the country and not the city. How much she can't stand where we live and is crying most days.

We then look for a house in a rural area, I never planned on staying in the apartment anyway, but we were already in debt from moving down here, now we are moving again, luckily we managed to avoid a down payment and closing costs. We have nothing in savings, as we are constantly going somewhere, she thinks we need to go on a date, and she's to tired during the day to do anything so all we do together is clean when I get home from work. We are now living in the only house we can afford in a rural area. 

For a bit she is okay. Still need to go out, still visiting family(which is really just spending the weekend at her mom's house and she sleeps in, we don't actually go visit the rest of the family that she complains she misses and says that we don't see enough). 

About 6 months in she starts again. She's homesick. I don't know what to do. For a bit I was setting a psychiatrist and was getting help for my depression, but I just don't see the point anymore. The one I was seeing no longer works for the place I was going to so they canceled my appointment and I never rescheduled. 

We agreed to try and move to the half way point of here and her parents, but I don't think it's going to change anything, except put us in more dept and all she says is she doesn't care about the money. Only way I could think of to attempt to move was fix the crap wrong with the house we are living in and attempt to bring the value up. We still owe more than its worth and she just wants to sell it and buy a new place. We have a son who is about to be 2 and nothing in savings. 

Her mom does not help this either. They talk on the phone every afternoon and her mom always brings up how much she misses us and can't wait for us to visit. It'll only have been a day after we left their house. We don't really visit when we are there just stay over. Her dad works and her mom watches TV and gets on Facebook.

Honestly if it wasn't for my son I wouldn't want to be here anymore. My company offers life insurance and mine is at $20k that would go to her right now. That would be enough to bury me her to sell the house and get what she really wants which seems to be to live with her parents. 

She's also talked suicide and I don't know how to handle this. I feel trapped. If I say something the wrong way she snaps. I dread coming home from work in the afternoon. ",4,"wife is depressed, close to family, had to move, she miss her family , grandmother passed away, drove her to edge"
No one in my family knows. The days I wake up so late because it's impossible to wake up. All the student loan debt that is creeping on my back and I still haven't graduated yet. All the failed classes because I just can't focus anymore. I've really never known what to do and nobody in my family knows. Wondering if there are other people like me out there,2,"student loan is creeping up, still havent graaduated, all the failed classes, cant focus anymore."
"Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered ""brothers"", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered ""brothers"" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do.

"Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe.

See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. 

Thank you for taking the time.

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc√© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc√©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. 

I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that? And to top it off, I knew he had feelings for a girl at the time so i probably just fucked up their relationship. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't normally have a high sex drive either.

"Good day everyone!

I have decided to write my story here, since it seems that there might be some people here who might relate to me and maybe give insight.

TLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.

So going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.

Let me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.

Then there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was ""You should get more experience before offering help"" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.

This helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was ""Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party"" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.

Also at workplace i often get the same ""Disrespect"" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like ""Well its obvious thanks for the help"", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.

But the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like ""Get more experience"" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?

Oeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.

Thank you,
I just wanted to write this out!",2,"feeling more negative than positive, doing masters ,get no pleasure,"

Sorry for the bad english, i don't have anyone else to talk. This week has been very hard. I've hated myself more than ever and even taking my medications has failed to dispel the emotional pain I feel.

I have told her that I'm there for her on multiple occasions, but haven't been able to help her in any other way, at least one that feels like it's had a meaningful effect. Her performance in school has progressively been going down; the only thing that seems important to her is theater. Im sure you all know how high school theater is. Self-confidence can either thrive or struggle to survive in there.

I have tried to coax her into adopting a hobby like drawing, just anything to use her time constructively, but to no avail. Some days she simply chooses to stay in her room.

"A few months ago I was hired by a very well-known business. I had to leave my other job abruptly because this new job was paying my $15 an hour which is damn near double the amount I was making at my old job. 

I wanted to give my old job a two-weeks notice but I couldn't because the new job couldn't give me a proper state date then they finally told me it would be the following Monday which was three days later. It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.

Monday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. 

I finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). 

New job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.

I simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...

I'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison.

I guess i should be making this posts in a trowaway, but i think i'll end up forgetting this one, so i prefer to use my main and i think i'll better be plain and transparent in this but not getting also too much into detail in the public thread, so i'll start introducing myself. My name is Victor, i'm from Spain and 30 y/o. The last 5-6 years for me have been utter downhill. I feel i lost everything i cared for in my life. My house, my relationship, jobs, friends... sometimes i think i am kind of a reverse King Midas, in the sense everything i touch becomes shit (again, not giving many details on public just in case, if you're interested just pm). I would really like to turn this situation around, i'd like to fix all the things that are wrong with me (and i am already working on this but its not going to be fast), and i would like to talk to people without being all gloomy or have to fake smiles. In the beginning i was capable of that, telling some jokes, faking smiles, making everyone think i was allright and break crying when i was at home alone, but recently since i moved back to my parent's this has become harder and harder. They are great, and my brothers too, but i really can't put more weight on their shoulders. Sometimes i feel like i only need someone who i can talk to, trust, be a little understood or share my feelings without being judged or told things like the usual ""you'll get better, yay!"" kind of thing.
I do freelance work from home, not earning much and not having many opportunities to meet people or pay for professional help, and i don't really know how to start getting out of this situation. The best thing i could come up was this post so you can figure out how lost i am in that sense.
Any recommendations on how can i approach meeting new people and possibly get all the things off my chest in order to regain some confidence in myself and hopefully be back on track?

"For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur. Since I've been diagnosed with severe depression in August I tried medication and am currently in therapy. It kinda helps but over the past week I thought a lot. I don't think I can do this. I don't even know if I'm going to be alive at the end of 2017 - but I have to. It just seems so much right now. The break-up, depression, moving out, having no close friends at my university, no sure if I even want to study the subjects I'm studying. I don't know where to begin; where to start fixing this mess I made. I fucked up. I'm not sure what to do when I'm alone in my flat tomorrow evening. I don't even want to think about that situation.

"I'm so confused and fucking afraid. I've always been lonely,  but I accepted it as a kid. That no matter how hard you try, there are just some people who will always be the black sheep. I was fine with it, even though I didn't like it.

But now, I really want to end it. You don't understand, I have this need to run something sharp across my throat, to set myself alight... I feared death to the point where I was scared of going to sleep because maybe I wouldn't wake up. But I can't do it, I can't do it because suicide would shame my family so much that it would destroy my family.

"I'm 6'4"", 36 years old, and have the typical dad bod physique, so it's been as long time since I've taken a bath.  It's just not practical in the least. As I type, I've got maybe a third of my body actually submerged, and that's just how it goes for large people in a typical tub. 

Anyway, that's not at all the point of my post, I just wanted to give some frame of reference for my state of mind. Today I've reached a new low, I feel utterly hopeless, sad, and lonely. So much so that some primal urge to crawl back into the womb prompted me to draw a bath in an attempt to find some basic comfort. 

I'm married and have a 6 year old daughter; my daughter just knows that mom and dad fight a lot, which is bad enough, so I'm trying to spare her in any way I can manage. It's impossible not to let depression impact a close family relationship, even when it's the single most important relationship in your whole life.  My wife has struggled with depression herself, but she's little help in this situation, and often only serves to make it worse. 

As I sit here in the tub, mostly exposed to the cold air, partially submerged in rapidly cooling water, I'm trying to figure out how I even got here. Did I really make such poor decisions in my life? Is everything that has brought me to this state entirely my fault? And that's when it hit me; the ultimate analogy for life as it applies to my current situation: Life is a journey. This is not a new metaphor for life, and all of what just occurred to me has likely occurred to many others, but it was an important revelation that I at least wanted to share. 

Life is a journey, we all have to make choices that determine where we'll end up; our ultimate destination. I have always known that I've made poor decisions in my life that have put me on a more difficult path, but I've also had circumstances outside of my control that have also had significant impact. Some people are fortunate enough to have support and guidance in their journey, from people who have done well or been lucky in their life choices. That's wonderful, I envy that tremendously. 

For those of us who didn't have that benefit, it means flying blind a lot of the time. Imagine that you are driving somewhere really far off that you've never been to before and all you've got is a super vague map with most of the route completely missing. Sure everyone's life is like that to a degree, but some people have those they can ask for directions, people who are invested in their successful journey. A lot of us don't have that, so every turn is a roll of the dice. Some get it right, some get it wrong, some find immediate disaster. 

I feel like the last fifteen years or more, aside from having my daughter, almost every single decision has made my journey more and more difficult, and taken me further from where I want to be. I feel like a refugee in my own life.

In the analogy of life being a journey, there is no going back and making course corrections. I can't go back to the intersection of Work and College and make a different choice despite the circumstances, I can only try to keep going towards my destination and hope to find that intersection again. You can only move forward, there is no going back, so it's easy to just get completely and utterly lost. 

Now, as I've said, I know I'm here because of my own poor decisions, but is it fair that I be stuck here indefinitely? I don't have people I can ask for help. I don't have resources to pay somebody to care about my well-being.

I am in the middle of a place I don't want to be, scared to death, and have no idea how I'm going to get out of here.",5,"depressed, want comfort, married  , 6 year old daughter, wife struggling with depression too, want someone to take care and talk to"
"My friend keeps talking about his depression, but I can't tell if he really is depressed or is just going through a rough patch in his life. He still gets out of bed to hang out with us and he just graduated college. 

But he gets very emotional when he drinks, and is either really happy or really sad. When we all hang out, as a group of guys we all make fun of each other because that's what guys do, but are careful not to push his buttons too much. He broke up with his girlfriend who he cheated on a few times, but keeps texting her wanting to get back together with her. He always wants to talk about very sad things, and doesn't ever act happy when he comes out with us.

What I don't get is if he's depressed, wouldn't it be hard for him to get out of bed? He invites us over his house to do stuff, but then just wants to talk about how sad he is and it makes me and our group of friends not want to hang out with him anymore.

I've tried to help him the most, listening to him whenever he asks me for help, inviting him out, and offering advice when he asks for it. But he never listens to me, and just blames his ""depression"" all of the time, and it's really dragging my friends down (not so much me though because I don't let his feelings affect mine, but it does get exhausting having to listen to him go on about this.)

He says he's going to a psychologist for help, but that he hates going there. He hasn't talked to his parents at all about it, and refuses to tell his older sisters either, which is surprising because he does have a very supportive family. Their family isn't the best shape financially, but it certainly isn't the worst.

I feel like he's more so upset because he compares himself and his life to others, and granted things haven't gone his way all the time, but that's normal, is it not?

I live together with my 3 best friends because my home is too far away from school. Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed.

I sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer.

My gf was the only one  trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most.

I completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). 

We just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so...

Everyday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT.

"Hi everyone.  
This is a throw away.  
I don't know if I have the right to say I'm depressed because I mostly think that I'm making it up in my head.  
There are some times when I'm fine but then I get really sad moment every 2 weeks and every 2 or 3 months everything becomes really dark and I just stay in bed for days. Sometimes I think of killing myself a lot, I really dream of doing it, sometimes I plan it, but I never did anything close to it. Just self harm or eating to the point where it hurts, sex addiction, drinking, smoking.  
I never was in a relationship, no man ever said they loved me until I was 26 years old. I had given up on it by then and I had decided to write all my goodbye letters and go on a trip to NZ and die there.  
But then I met a guy I really liked spending time with, and he told me he loved me, I couldn't believe it but after a while I felt it too, or let myself feel it too, and we've been dating since. After that for the first time in 10 years I felt quite good and took up new hobbies and was seeing a future for myself. All this time I still felt that there's something wrong with him for loving me, but I was able to enjoy it while it lasted.  
We're still together now, but I want to leave him. He didn't do anything wrong and he is still great but I feel like I'm a weight and just the worst person to have feelings for. I don't understand his love. He is blinded by I don't know what. What can I add to his life? Absolutely nothing. Just negative things. I want to sabotage this whole thing or ghost him.  
I'm really lost because in the past I have been able to see what I was unsatisfied by in our relationship, he has also brought up some things I was doing badly and all these things have been talked through and worked on and corrected. But now I just want to be alone and stop suffering, the fact that I'm weighing him down is just another thing making me sad. I want to be cold to him so that he finally leaves.  
He is trying to be supportive but I don't want to ask for his help anymore. When his presence doesn't help, both of us just feel worse. And I don't think another person can fix/heal me so it's pointless.  
  
Sorry for this long rant. I guess I was just hoping to see if anyone has ever felt this before?

After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation.

At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one.

I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out.

Update: were 17 so her mom found out there was pot at new year's and said she can't go on our dinner and movie date but we will be going on a lunch date",4,I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message
"Hi everyone, I should've done a throw away account. 

I found this subreddit recently and I'm not sure where to start exactly. Not sure if this is even the right place. I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things 

I was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.

 I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. 

I've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.

In the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. 

I know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me. Instead I spend my time sweating my ass off while my 50 something coworker just supervises and judges everything I do.

Guys I'm just gonna stop for today

"I don't even *know* what to say, I'm only posting here because I don't have anyone in real life to talk about these feelings with. Well, other than my girlfriend who can only say so much to help. She's a good sport about it at least and never complains about me complaining. 

I just feel very hopeless. I'm 23 and haven't accomplished too much yet in life. I dropped out of college a few years ago and honestly have no desire to go back. That's the thing, I have no desire to do anything. I don't get it. I take the medicine, I talk to my therapist weekly and learn ways to manage negative thoughts but it all feels very bogus to me. I see no point in doing anything that doesn't offer an instant reward. I see people around me who are so passionate about so many things in life but I've never been genuinely passionate about anything, at least not for very long. My interests come and go. I hear of people getting over their depression but I have a hard time believing that I'm going to just **get over** what I feel is a huge part of who I am. I have memories as far back as age 5 and even before and I always remember being nervous and anxious and having this feeling of constant impending doom. I know this sounds negative but I genuinely think I was just born with a brain with faulty code. I like computers and know that sometimes things just go wrong and you have to hit the reset button, but I can't reset my brain. I don't even know where this is going or why I'm even posting. I'm just really overwhelmed and sad and needed to shout into the void I guess. Thanks for listening.

"I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and how they handled it.
I an 32 years old and I have a mix of anxiety and depression, and often find I am really only feeling ""ok"" when I am at work of asleep, especially in the winter.  This winter I have been really lonely, having pushed away/ been pushed away by most of my friends (getting older is a bitch.  I used to be a popular guy, now I'm pretty isolated and lonely).
So, lately, I have been working pretty hard, and then when I get home I just want to put on the TV and go to bed, even at 5 or 6 PM.  Part of the problem is I will wake up after like 4-6 hours, even if I am still tired, even if it is just midnight.  The even bigger problem is that I have been having all these weird, self-injurious thoughts.  When I have them, I am really horrified and feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about it.  When I am falling asleep, I will *JOLT* awake, and this will happen over and over.  I also have weird thoughts that I might jump out of my window or do something self-injurious while I am asleep, which terrifies me.  I know this is all sort of irrational. Unlike some other people on here who contemplate suicide, I never do that.  It's more like an OCD fear that pops into my head that I might lose control impulsively, or something might happen while I'm asleep.  Sometimes I'm using scissors or a knife and I will have the same weird fear wash over me, and I literally have to put down whatever I am doing and walk away from it.  I don't trust myself.  Is that weird?
Recently, the thoughts are really escalating to a point where I am sometimes really unable to go to sleep for a long time.  Sometimes I will start drinking, just to sedate myself to chill out for bed.  Any idea what may be going on?  I'd be interested to hear if other people have had this experience of Sleep Jolts and Obsessive fears of self-injury?",5,"mix of anxiety and depression, cannot sleep, wake up in middle even when toired, OCD, no friends"
"So this happened a while ago and is pretty much in the past, but I went through some sort of drug induced psychosis or something. I don't know what happened but I went from half a year or so of doing nothing with my life and having no prospects, to utter ecstasy, in 45 minutes one night, the amount of time it takes for MDMA to kick in. I felt like I was the second coming of Jesus Christ, for a week, a month after, I don't know. Some sort of headspace where I thought I was the one with the ideas to save humanity. Depression to ectsasy in under an hour. I remember I had this thought ""repression of expression turns depression into aggression"", I'll get to why.

But shortly thereafter (in the days following the ""comedown"" of the MDMA but I didn't really come down, more like drug induced psychosis) I was having panic attacks and couldn't function and thought I was going to die sometimes for whatever reason. Just paranoia or whatever... very real paranoia, but just that, nothing more. It's sort of a blur looking back on it I don't remember the exact sequence of events. But eventually after ending up in the mental hospital emergency so many times they just said ""this time, you can't leave. You have 2 choices: voluntary or involuntary patient"". So I spent a night there... and that was it I didn't know how long I was going to be there. It gives a new perspective on life and how long it takes for you to start scoping out an escape route. Let's call it real life escape from Cidna mines in skyrim. It wasn't that bad though you know, comfortable beds, nice people, decent food. But there was an irony of me sitting across a table from a man scribbling ""BUZZ LIGHTYEAR"" in crayon all over a page and me scribbling circuit schematics for voltage dividers to try and explain to the nurses I was sane so they could let me out. I didn't need to plot an escape route though because I was released the next day. But for whatever reason, when I got home, this huge wave of depression hit me.... maybe it was just the rapid change of environment.... freedom, no freedom, freedom. What the hell am I supposed to do, that was the thought that came to my head... what does society want of me? To cure my diseased mind, or to put my unique mind to creative work? I didn't eat anything and just slept and then the next morning had some sort of panic attack or whatever and next thing I know I'm outside just screaming at nothing. I was hungry and thirsty and just wanted some fucking food and here are all these houses and I knocked on a door just to see if someone was there to help me but no. What a sick fucking society we live in, me with not enough water to get up over the hill (I was down in elevation maybe 100 feet, that's a big hill when you haven't eaten or drank anything and are depressed and don't have the energy to get up the hill). Yet here are dozens or maybe hundreds of houses all with water pipes in them and I can't have any. I was screaming ""GIVE ME SOME FUCKING WATER"" but of course no response. I finally just stood in the road and forced a guy in a truck to stop and I asked for his phone, and to prove to him I wasn't a thief I threw my shoe in his truck so that I'd be disadvantaged if I were to run away with his iphone. Just the fact that he gave me his waterbottle (the spontaneous social camaraderie) and the water got me up the first 50 feet or so back home. Then I just lied in the ditch because I didn't have the energy to get back up over the hill. A few cars drove by until a woman finally stopped, but (understandably looking back at it now) she drove by slowly with the doors locked and that she was of no real help (she offered some help but from a distance, not with the metaphorical open arms of the pickup truck guy) and considered me a criminal so I just yelled at her ""go the fuck to work"" or something really nasty and she drove off. But the fact that she had stopped at all gave me the energy... social comradery or whatever at least helped me find the energy to get back home.

Anyways the point of all that was that I couldn't function after that MDMA roll. I can function now, at least. But all my life I've had this anxiety of not being able to express myself in public speaking. Which is ironic because I've played music on stage in front of so many people. But I just have this fear of expressing myself, and when the fear finally burst and I spoke my mind, I lost my freedom, they put me in a mental hospital. So you can't blame me that I'm not too keen to really speak out in front of people that much... at all. I'm a smart guy, I have an engineering degree, I could design and build a computer from scratch given enough time and resources, but I just can't do the social thing. I mean in school or university they don't mind so much the creative or different ways of thinking but the mental hospital, society in general, considered me diseased. I don't relate to people that much. I haven't been on a date for almost a decade... and even back in highschool I never really connected with the girl I dated. I don't know if I did it to myself or if I'm a byproduct of the north american k-12 ""education"" system.

I just need to be able to relate to people. I can't do that and it's slowly killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm happy, but depression isn't happiness or sadness and although I've been given the same result, ""mildly/not depressed"", by different doctors, there is disorder there somewhere and I don't know how to turn it into just normal people order.",3,"drug induced, MDMA, panic attacks, real paranoia,  admitted to hospital, need to relate to people"
"Not in a literal context but I really do feel like I'm regaining my life from someone else's control after a decade of numbing myself from meaningful social interaction.

Now the real me wants to shine but I don't know how to do it and no one wants to give me a second chance.  It's as if I was spreading a rumor about myself.

"Hey guys, I am 16 and have been depressed for many years, but I started to make some huge progress a few weeks before New years. I started to eat healthy, lost weight, even went out a lot and hung out with some girls that I would have never had the balls to talk to before.

-

For some reason, I became confident, determined, and enthusiastic about life in the blink of an eye. Well that all changed when I woke up to an ambulance arriving at my house and carrying out my mom who had just collapsed. Me and my sister thought it was just a small thing, we did not realize that we would be in for the worst news of our lives when our dad got back from the hospital.

-

My dad arrived home with our grandparents and started crying as he explained to use that our mom had just died from a heart attack. She was only 49 and had no health problems. My whole family broke down crying as I just stood there in shock, I didn't cry, I didn't say a word. I just stood there with disbelief.

-

The second day of the new year, and I've already lost hope, as I'm sure my sister has too. I believe she died because of so much stress that a heart attack was caused, I know that she had been very down lately and I felt very bad for her, but I never said anything to her to explain that I was feeling the same. I feel like if I had just said something, maybe just maybe she would be alive, BUT I DIDN'T. 

-

Not only that, but I never got to say goodbye, I didn't get to hold her hand as she died. I didn't even get to go to the hospital or see her in the morning, I didn't even get to say goodnight the night before. All I can think about is how much I miss her, I just want to hear her voice one more time, go on one more walk with her, something. But I can't.

  About 4 months ago,  the (39f)woman (37m)I love of 10 years went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you"" in the span of a week.  In a text at that. I have tried reaching out to her, but received only venom in return.  She was my life, my happiness, my fiancee,  and my drive. 
  The back story is long, and while I would love support and ideas, I don't really expect anyone to read this or care.  I just have no friends,  nor am I good at making them.  So, this is the only Avenue I can think of to try, nor am I a good writer.   Also,  this is on my phone,  so sorry if I miss any autocorrects.   So, here goes, it will be long, but, as this is more because I don'tknow what to do,  understanding would require a good amount knowledge of me.  While this is long, sadly,  it's only scratching the surface. 
  I suffer from depression and anxiety.   In the military is was diagnosed with Bpd.   I have never been popular or had many friends.   I try here and there to make them, I usually wind up being the target for people to make fun of.  It has become a place in life where I just fit in.  The doctor said my depression will never go away, and all I can try to do is mitigate. 
  To start, I was conceived due to my mom's depression.   While I was due in December,  she decided to force labor in Oct.   Unfortunately,  I lived.
  When I was 13, my parents divorced over drugs.  Both were in a bad place.  My dad told me if I didn't go with him, he would kill himself.   So, being a child,  I chose to live with him.  At that point,  we moved around to the point due to his contract labor,  I went to 17 highs schools.   Making friends became impossible.   
  Because he was strung out.  He was making me pay rent to live at home at 16.  My mom would not let me go with her because she was bitter.   So, went to school and worked full time.  Until I turned18, and joined the military 5 days later.
  In the military,  people come and go all the time.   So, I didn't make friends because,  well, I was used to that.  However,  I wound up being made fun of regularly .  Mainly because I liked to read dungeons and dragons books to escape reality.
  I went out and met a woman,  who I dated for 3 months before making the mistake of marriage.   While I was out to sea, her and her boyfriend cleaned out my life savings of about  $30,000.   I flew home for us to transfer unawares to ""here's the keys to your truck, I want a divorce,  goodbye.""
  I moved because I had to.  And met a girl who thought it was a fun game to mess with me.  Cheating and coming back crying.   Because of this,  I used to sleep with a loaded shotgun pointed at my head.   Finally,  one night, I was getting drunk and ready when.  When I had the gun in my mouth,  someone walked in,  and called the cops.  So I spent a while in the hospital. 
  I then met a different woman who got pregnant. So, I married her (46f)so she would have insurance for the baby.  Which was my oldest daughter.   The wife quickly got pregnant again and had my son just before I was out of the Navy.  She was from Texas, so when I got out, after 7 years in, we moved to Indiana.
  In the need to find work,  I took a truck driving job, where I received a letter in the mail that I had a 10 year old son.  Long story short,  the girl who took my virginity had gotten pregnant and never told me. I was hammered with support and much back support,  putting me in a position where I lost everything.   The woman only wanted the money,  and while I get I did the deed, after 10 years, I had made many choices this knowledge would have impacted greatly. 
  The wife, knowing I loved my children,  would then cheat on me regularly,  always threatening to take my kids away to texas if I didn't like it.   By this point,  I made little working in customer service.   So, I couldn't afford a lawyer.   And in Indiana,  men never get the kids.  So, she did whatever she wanted,  virtually holding me hostage to my kids.
  Then, I met this (39f)woman.  We became best friends.   She was engaged to someone outside the country.   We would sit and talk for hours.   We did everything  together,  and our kids did things together.  We actually had everything in common.      Her new husband,  wound up being a lazy mommas boy.  And while she tried over the next couple of years ,  he just couldn't be motivated to...do anything.   She then while I didn't notice,  started doing things for me like dying her hair blonde. 
  Her and I decided to try to make better futures,  so we went to ITT together.   After class, always talking for hours.   At this point we had known each other for roughly 6 years.   One night however,  it hit me.  Where I accidentally told her I loved her.   I knew I thought it,  I guess,  in a way where it wasn't my active thought,  but, I guess I didn't realize how powerful it was.  
  Some back story on her.  She grew up being made fun of also, suffered from depression,  and had a rather uncaring mother.  Her first husband who fathered her children abused her, and the second took advantage.   When I tried to make more friends,  she got upset.   So when I talked to her about it,  she preferred it to just be us.   Once I understood,  I complied.   More people meant more chances of getting hurt.  Once she felt someone hurt her, nothing mattered, they were the enemy.
  Over this time,  there was never a time she called me for help i didn't come running.   I actually liked helping her.  Seeing her smile,  just...made me feel good.    From helping her find a place to live,  to mowing her lawn because her husband couldn't be bothered.   I never once told her no.
  After I told her I loved her (call her k), with my wife being pregnant again,  things changed.   She told me she loved me.  We spent hours discussing it.  Like fate brought us together .  The wife, who had had more boyfriends,  one who's wife got her fired I believe got pregnant on purpose so I wouldn't leave.  I work, I pay bills, and I have nothing I can do about it. 
  I talked to the wife, and she agreed to let her move in for a 3 way relationship.   K then left her husband who moved back home,  and moved in with her and her kids.  This was not a bad thing until the wife got jealous.    I spent my time with k, letting her do what she wanted,  but anytime I was happy,  it made the wife upset.  So, eventually things bored over and k moved out and in with her mother. 
  The wife went back to her ""other"" friends while still threatening me regularly.   The relationship with k became mostly by phone and weekends since she was now an hour away.   Also complicated with poor Internet at her mom's, so messages didn't always get through.  Sometimes having to send multiple before she would get the notice.  This continued for a couple of years.   Though,  any time she told me she needed me I was there.   Bringing her and her kids with us anytime me and my kids did anything.  Hell,  if she wanted anything,  I would jump through hoops to try to make it happen.  To be honest,  anything that made her smile, made my day.  Our love, and friendship was what kept me going.   K also became attached to my youngest.   
  Before my daughter came, this year I was planning for a divorce as my kids would be old enough to choose.  And support for my son ended. However,  a couple of lawyers told me a judge won't split the kids, so she would get them. Then I wouldn't be able to stop her from moving back to texas. 
  So, in March, k told me things needed to change,  and she gave me some rules.   Like no ""relations"" with the wife.   I think I understood what she was wanting.    So I came up with a plan to give her what she wanted.   K was going through some rough times.   I had to give her what she wanted without stressing her out.  So, I didn't tell her about it. 
  I spent the next six months in solitude in the bedroom.   The wife sleeps in the den.  I needed to do a few things.  Make it easier on the kids to move away from me by making them indifferent towards me.  Make it easier on me by getting used to not talking to them so much.   Then buy time for support for the other child to end.  While having time to talk to a lawyer,  and start preparing for a divorce. 
   I checked with k regularly in order to be sure we were good.   For I was going stir crazy.  I ended up stressing out k.   I didn't realize that even though I grew up alone, how much being around her regularly meant to me.   Right at a time when her work and kids made seeing each other difficult.   I'm sure I was driving her insane.   I was trying to protect her, and in doing so screwed up.  I got jealous she was talking to her ex husband.  Jealous over trying to get time with her.  
  She was having trouble with the relationship with her son, problems at her underemployed job, car problems,  problems with money, among other things.   So I set out and worked on getting her a job that would have started last week that would have paid double what she was making. 
  In August,  support was over, I set up a date with her.  I had this big dinner planned.  Ready to tell her everything,  ready to tell her I was about to give her everything she asked me for.   I was as excited as anyone can be.  She canceled the first time because her son wanted to do something with her.   Since she was working on building a relationship with him, I got that.
  The next week was my son's birthday,  which I checked everything with her.  She promised everything was fine, that she was ready for us to finally be together,  and she loved me and we made love.   So I made plans for the next weekend with her, for telling her everything.    A couple of days later, I got into it with a lady from work to the point we were yelling.   I went to smoke to calm down, with a text telling me she was canceling because her son just made his first girlfriend and her family invited her over for dinner. 
  I screwed up.  I called and asked if she was blowing me off again.   She hung up.   So I screwed up again and called back like 20 times.   Finally,  we talked.  I apologized.  Then, that Sunday,  we're were texting and she just disappeared.   I sent a few messages over a few hours tryingto reach her.  One, my youngest wanted to talk to her, two, I wanted to tell her about a show, and 3, I wanted to remake plans to tell her about everything, that everything she asked me for was coming true.
  I woke up to a text, that I was smothering her, and that she was done with me and blocking me.   I was lost.   I tried to explain,  but was blocked before I could.   We had been best friends for 10 years.  Lovers for 4.  And all I got was a text.  I tried emailing from a couple of different addresses.  Sending flowers.  She told me to fuck off, and stop being a stalker.   
  I let the wife read my emails to her.  So she understands I will no longer be held hostage.  However,  k never either read them or cared.  She just went 180¬∞.  I've never let anyone..in before.   It only meant pain.  She said I was a manipulating controlling jerk.  But, I never didn't do anything she asked.  Ever.  I wasn't allowed to question her, so, I just complied.  I didn't mind, except like anyone,  I can get emotional,  and at times had trouble not asking questions. Her love was worth it. 
  We used to sit and talk all night.  About anything and everything.   We would sit on the porch,  and talk from sundown to sunup.  She became part of me.  Part of my every thought.   We had everything in common.   Most people thought she was my wife. When we were physically together,  the world was good.    She was going to be my only support in losing my kids.
  Now, I sit here, having given up everything for her, and she will never probably speak to me again.  I love her.  I wasn't depressed when she was around.   I have no friends.   I have no outlets that don't make me think of her.  I have nothing.   I never got to tell her, because I wanted to protect her.  My depression has drove me back to drinking.   I can't afford therapy.   I don't have anyone in the world who cares.  
   If anyone actually read this.  I'm the type that ""everything will work out"" is just empty words.  Fate I believe meant for me to be with her.  I no longer know what to do,  or how to continue. 
  All doors are closed.  I can't seem to find an open door anywhere.  I'm broken.   I'm worthless.   I'm having trouble finding reasons to not end it.  I wasn't supposed to survive being born anyways.   My life insurance would help set the kids for life.  She was everything to me.  After a lifetime of being made fun of, people hurting me, she broke through and made me feel human.  Now, this is gone.  No explanation,  on a text.  I must be worthless to throw away that easy.
  
  This is just more details.    Adding on as I go.  Maybe someone can help me.   Or, maybe my story will make someone else feel better about their situation.   Either way,  I'm laying it all out there.    

  The job.
 
    I explained earlier that k also suffered from depression.   She did the cutting thing.  I won't say I don't understand as over the last few months,  I have considered it.  We spent a lot of time discussing our depression.   Going over the ups and downs.   She had been mistreated by family and the men in her life.  I made her a promise to not be on that list. 
  When we worked at the same place, we made one hell of a team.  She always had the best evaluations.  Right up until our new auditor made a mistake,  took it to our new boss, who was prone to jumping the gun before understanding the situation.   So she was let go.  This crushed her confidence.   While I was able to later research and show it was an error on their part, it was too little too late. 
  Then she had a period of unemployment,  being turned down for various positions.   As I watched her fall apart,  all I could do was comfort her.  Always reminding her how awesome she was.   Though,  she quickly became numb to me telling her so.  Then she took a position as a security guard just to pay the bills.   Totally underemployed.   All I again could do was try to remain positive for her.  Reminding her how amazing she was.  However,  she started to reach the point where she felt like it was the best she could do.  Knowing she can run circles around most everyone in almost any type of analytical work, it was not easy to watch.
   A few months later,  I was let go for much the same reason.   I got lucky and found a good position in production logistics analytics.   While she was happy for me, well, you know.  
  Then she called me up telling me she was done with her current job due to b.s. she was dealing with.   Then she was fine with it.  Then she was done again.   I didn't know whether to push or what.   Push too much,  she would get angry.  Don't push,  I'm not helping.   She means the world to me.   Not an easy spot to be in.
   Honestly,  she's better than me at everything.  So, after I had been here for a while,  I just happened to report to a plant manager.   While I'm on good terms with the other plant manager.   I'm also good at my job.  So when I told them I knew someone better,  they were very interested.  However,  she doesn't think she interviews well.  So, I worked out something awesome with my plant managers.   They would help her resume, then give her a ""mock"" interview  to help her out.  Let's just say , the job paid much better,  and it was hers.  This was part of what I was working on that I never got to tell her was set up.  She would have started today on January 3rd.  
  I work for great people,  so while it's a fast paced job due to ""just in time "" production.   So the job especially since its a larger corporation really a diamond in the rough.   Not to mention,  you literally decide your hours based on your responsibilities.   Making things like doctor visits easy.  With full benefits from day one. 
  This was huge since when support for my kids kicked in,  I wanted us to be able to support ourselves without having to scrape by.  Also, allowing us to do things for her kids and mine.

  Anxiety. 
  When we started school,  she had major anxiety issues with being in a small room with a bunch of people.  So, I had to work hard to make her focus on me, and not the room.   My issue is the same yet different,  as I have trouble with moving masses.  Like the mall is overwhelming to me with tons of people going all different directions.   She was the only one who ever helped through things like this.  Keeping me focused on her.  
  My other issues are more like just missing her.  In ten years,  we hadn't ever been not around each other for a full week.   She was my .....Center.  when she was around,  my back pain stopped,  and I could relax.  She was amazing. 
  
  The move out
  The night she moved out was a messy night.   The wife had been pushing her to find someone else.   So, she started talking with a guy several states away.   K was very...inebriated.   My daughter  admittedly rudely, read some stuff over her shoulder.   
 She yelled at her and went downstairs.   I was told something was up.  When I asked, all she yelled out the door was for her kids to get in the car.   So, I busted the door open to stop this.  I was not going to let her drive, especially with the kids in the car while wasted.   I argued with her to call her mom.   When I went to stop her, she went off (I don't blame her, the wife made the situation unbearable) and started hitting me.   So, I grabbed her and held her through biting me enough to leave a mark for years.   I let her up when she agreed to call for a ride.   I was probably wrong here, but, I was worried about people I loves safety. 
  Her memory of the night is completely different,  as I held her against her will.  She just wanted to wait in the car for her mom whom she said she had already texted.   She didn't tell me at the time, nor did her mom when I called her.  But, I guess I was wrong?
  This was the only physical encounter.   To be honest,  I was amazed at myself.   I think I would have lost it with anyone else in this world.  This by the way,  made me realize how much I love her.
  
    The ex

  I don't know why, but I would get jealous when she would talk to her ex.   He's half a world away.  So I get I'm being dumb.   But, it was still painful to me.   She didn't understand why, I couldn't explain,  so it was a running issue.  While he was not husband material,  she did want to be friends with him.  Have to admit,  I can't be all wrong here, since she found it so easy to get rid of me.

  No one will probably read this much.   But, I want to get everything out there.  Again,  there is more, but, I'm having trouble typing this because my anxiety has me shaking.   I wish I could erase her from my memory.   I just don't know how.   
  
  The bubble.
   She has a personal bubble that she lets very few people in to.  I get this as I have it too.  If you see her in general, she would prefer you just pretend she didn't exist.    I also usually feel the same here.  Our bubbles,  oddly seemed attracted to each other.   We could both deal with someone when we were together.   Split us up, and it was right back to square one. 

  The breakdown 
  At one point,  I had reached my breaking point.   Now,  I'm used to back pain from anxiety.   It's become part of my life.   There however was a time I just completely snapped.   I don't remember much but crying.   Expect that at one point,  and Angel showed up and took me in her arms.  The pain stopped.   Problems stopped.  The world was a new place.   When I realized it was k,  I knew at that moment,  all movies and stuff aside,  she was the one.  The you wait a lifetime for.   The one who is that other half of everything wrong with you. 
  She also had a moment like this,  and wrote me a letter expressing fate, and that I was hers forever.   I agreed and she had me promise to stick by this.  I did, and I will say I have never broke a promise to her.
  
  Now for tryingto email her, she has labeled me a stalker.   While I would never invade her personal space without invitation.   So crazy, she went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you ""   no explanation.   No quarter given.  I'm just supposed to walk away.  Like nothing mattered.   Like naming my daughter after her, always being that and dropping everything for her didn't matter.   I question.   What's the point of trying anything anymore.

I know school is important but I'm disencouraged to pursue it. I can't seem to do anything normal teens do like going out, clubbing or partying or even casual picnics.

At first, it was because of family problems I ended up hating wanting money or needing it so I created a lifestyle for myself in which I don't use money or ask my parents for it. My life has always been sitting behind a screen watching people enjoy life and thinking to myself that once I get a bit older the family problems would be gone and the coast would be clear but I was dead wrong.

I can't really see a way out of the situation I'm in because weither its now or in the future, I will have to be in situations where the same family problems still present themselves..

"SORRY....BUT IT IS!!!

Obviously, if you are so depressed to the point where you have such a low mood that you don't eat, sleep, shower, socialize etc - and you do this for weeks/months/years - then it stands to reason that this is certainly an abnormal way of thinking and you should seek help.

BUT......nobody ever discusses the opposite - people who are so peppy and happy ALL THE TIME to the point where it's obnoxious. I know (and knew) some of these people and it makes me sick. What make sme even more frustrated is that this isn't acknowledge as a mental issue, but it certainly should be!

When we are first born, we are crying. It is a human instinct to cry or feel fearful when we are endangered, just like it's a natural instinct to smile or laugh when we are pleased. 

But what pisses me off are these people that go around with these big smiles and hearty personalities ALL THE TIME. Nothing seem sto phase them or make them deviate from their ""norm""....death of a loved one, job loss, etc. They always see a silver lining so bright that it probably blocks out every other fucking colour to them. 

And what does the mental health profession have to say about this? Absolutely nothing!!! I'm sorry, but just because you are outwardly happy all the time doesn't make you exempt from having mental illness - in fact, I'd be willing to bet that there's a whole lot of repression going on inside that mind. But that would make this JUST AS BAD a s chronic depression. 

As much as I hate struggling with depression, I hate seeing people who are the exact opposite. Don't make me puke!!!

Do any of you guys know somebody who's like this?

"I've been battling with severe depression and suicide for as long as I can remember. I dont know what is happening but in pushing myself out. Each day shines a little brighter everyday. I may only be 19 but I'd like to share what I wrote with all of you as well. I love you all and I'm always here if you need someone to talk too.

When I graduated this year I tried to make a little speech. I didn't rehearse it, or plan it and was pretty nervous so it wasn't much of anything. I'd like to try and share again what I said. I said how as we move forward a lot of people expect that life will change so much and become so much better just because you are moving to a new location or part of life but I don't think that's true. The only way life is going to change is by the change in your mind. The movement of the clock doesn't produce newness of life, but the movement of your mind. Everyone is going through a change. To a better level of yourself. Don't let your old habits dictate your life. It is cliche but new year, new you. I'm tired of doing what I used to do, if I always do what I've always done ill always be where I've always been. The real battleground is in your mind, you lie down with it, you wake up with it, go to work with it, you smile in front of others when no one knows whats going on inside. You will never be defeated by what others say about you, but what you say about you. New life comes from a new mind and a new way of looking at your life. For those that are close know I suffered from a lot of depression, and eventually suicidal thoughts this year. I owe so much to my friends and family who supported me. Let this be the year we change our minds. I cannot step into the future and still think in my past, I cannot let the rumors and the stain of what they said about me destroy my opportunity. I cannot drag that same old mess into another year. If you do what is easy, and do what I did and become sad and depressed and let life knock you around life will be hard. But if you do whats hard, and continue to work on yourself and grow life will be easy. Excuses sound best to the people who make them up. God made you and said I want you. You have to be willing to take everything life has to throw at you, but never forget you deserve greatness, no matter where you are now, keep that dream alive. You have to have faith, whatever your dream is you deserve it and it is worth whatever it takes. It was kind of rambled but heres to another year.

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights.

What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten.

If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end?

Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair.

I cannot remember my line of thinking at the time, but long story short, I found myself walking down the road (meaning I had walked down my driveway which is all jagged rock and about a mile long, and about another mile down the road). My pocket was full of pills and a knife-like object.

I believe I was headed to a pizza place which is miles and miles away. I've never actually put that into words, but I am now realising stupid that is. I have no idea why I was going to there. I either wanted to end it or run away, but again, it's fuzzy.

I am posting this to ask if it is a normal type of occurance or if it's indicative of something else or some other type of mental illness.

Thank you.",3,"mental healtg issues, given prozac, walking down the road, pocket full of pills and knife like object"
"I have a family of  75+ people on my mom's side, and I'm the only gay person. I'm also adopted, but I feel like I've never felt like I fit in in the family. I feel like the odd one out, the outcast, the black sheep. 


Whenever I talk to cousins or other family members, I don't feel like I belong. Also, I'm the only gay person, which I know my very Catholic family won't like when my partner and I get married. I feel like that'll just make things worse and that they'll shun me from the family. 


My parents are very conservative, however my brother and I are very close. He isn't adopted, he's my adoptive parents own kid. He's 28, and I'm 22. We like the same things, many of his friends are my friends, and we just get along so well! He's also non-religious, and has said that he will come to my wedding despite what my parents think or say.

"I'm 21 years old and a complete and utter disappointment to those around me.

I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom  sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses.

Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

I've failed trying to kill myself. I've failed academically. I've failed friends. I've failed my therapist. I've failed myself.

"Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now.

Yesterday my neighbors threw a party and I live on a military base so the walls are thin. They were being so loud and I like to think I'm a nice person. I usually take people's shit because I feel like I deserve everything bad that happens in my life. But last night I took a stand. I asked them if they could quiet down. They didn't quiet down so I got mad and frustrated. I usually do nothing and asking them to quiet down took a lot of energy from me so I called military police after that everyone left and I felt good. I felt like I actually stood up for my self for once. Next day I wake up and I tell my husband that I called the police on them. And he mad me feel like I shouldn't have done that. Am I wrong for calling the police on them? They do this every week. I've been in alaska for 6 months now and this is the first time I have every done somthing like this because I put up with people's shit. I just feel worse now because I thought I did the right thing but according to my husband I'm such a heartless person. Now I just feel awful agian. I think about just killing my self for the most littlest things. Like somthing like this. But then I think of my 4 year old son and what life he will have if I'm not there. And how selfish of me I would be to end my life. At the same time I think he would be better off. I just don't know how to cope with feeling like this everyday. Being an army wife and a mom to a 4 year old is just too much. What makes matters worse is I have no friends to vent about this. And I never ever post stuff on reddit. I'm just tired.

"My anxiety and depression is preventing me from living a normal life like most people. I'm isolating myself from friends and family. Its getting worse with time, and my suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more realistic every single day. My only option left that I believe might help me is telling my parents about everything, that I never go to school, and that I'm staying up all thinking I shouldnt exist anymore.

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean.

For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room).

I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion. However, I know that I can do 15 minutes a day. I have done it, I just haven't been able to keep the habit up. I want to make that habit and keep it going.

Useless backstory info: I'm a 17 yro closeted bisexual (mostly on the gay side) teen in the homophobic south. That's not completely my problem. Recently I've been feeling so numb to life and it's to the point where I don't see the point in living anymore. Thing is I'm afraid of dying. For a long time now I've been feeling alone and like I have no one in this life. People are the only thing that make life worth living. I'm not a shy or awkward guy but at this point I don't have many friends in my life. Awhile ago due to uncanny luck I started working at the same job as a guy that I've liked since nineth grade. We also take classes together this year. I don't know what I did but we somehow clicked and became close friends (not THE closest but close). He's a feminine guy so there was a time when I thought he felt the same way but do to his homophobic remarks about other gay people and him showing me a lot of the messages from girls he's been with (the normal guy thing I assume) I made an executive decision to back off of him in that way. However at this point in my life he is one of the only friends that I got and also (again despite us not being that close) the best friend I've got so I really don't wanna lose him. It feels like lately we've been drifting apart despite my absolute best effort to be more talkative, be funnier, and at some times pulling away do to me feeling that I've been coming on too strong. Losing him is my worst fear in the world. Not only is he the best friend I have rn but he's also a guy that I've liked for a long time now. It's like because of my apathy towards life, my loneliness, and my lust for him combined he's subliminally become my reason for living. I've been depressed for a while now and it's a sad thing when you at an age as young as 13 are trying to decide what song you're gonna kill yourself to. The only reason I'm still here today is because I promised myself that I would at least wait until the age of 27 to see if the shit about life getting better is true or not and I chose 27 because of Kurt Cobain. If I'm gonna die why not die with an artistic aesthetic in mind. However everyday I feel worse and worse and I thank my mom for being a responsible one and hiding her gun because idk if I'd be here today. With all that being said my question is this: Should I ask my mom to see a therapist/ psychologist or whatever? The reason I have to ask is because I fear my mom asking me and forcing me to tell her what I'm so upset about and I also fear not knowing what to tell the therapist and just wasting time and money or speaking too much and ending up in some kinda mental hospital. The worst part about all of this is feeling like I don't even have anyone (irl) to express my feelings of sadness to. I just feel like a dog in a cage and all I ever do is go to school, work, the come home and go to bed and I don't know what to do anymore. Am I just gonna be another gay statistic.

Short Version (less details): 
I'm a southern bisexual but mostly gay kid who's felt extremely lonely to the point of suicide for a long time now. I randomly by some stroke of luck became friends with a feminine guy who I've been enthralled with feeling for since 9th grade but found out he was straight. We're slowly losing our bond and I don't know what I'll do without him considering he is my only good friend at all rn. I'm feeling lonely, depressed and suicidal rn so should I ask my mom to see a therapist?

"I'm not insinuating suicide here, in any way, though I have had the thought. 

I'm stuck with controlling parents. Not to mention they are completely in denial about this subject. I don't trust them with ANY problems I have, big or small. I have never even been able to walk up to them and say ""hey I'm feeling down"" without it turning into a massive sprawl for outside help I don't want. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want their help. It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. 

However, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. 

They're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that. To them, I'm ""not trying hard enough."" And can I go to someone to vent, who I actually know and trust? No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. 

Not that I have a friend to run to, anyways. I mean, the only two people I even talk to are based solely on my comedic factor and emotional support(by that I support them) and so to them it seems like nothing is wrong with me. 

I want to be in a relationship, I do, but even at the age of 16 I've never had a girlfriend(serious, at least) and all my recent attempts have been met with rejection and then failed friendship. 

So I just don't know where to go. I can't keep up with grades, have no one to talk to, have given up on family, love, fashion, hobbies, school. Where am I to even go?

Not to top the traumatic shit that has happened to me. I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. 

Depression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. 

Not to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care. They're trying to shove help down my throat, but with good intention. 

So, all in all, my life is in shambles right now. I just don't know where to run. Maybe someone will read this whole thing and listen and relate, but I doubt it. 

Sorry if this is jumping around. I can't organize my thoughts properly right now. I'm sorry. ",4,"struck with controlling parenst, donít trust them, not allowing me to have friends, keep trapped in endless cycle of stress and sadness, grades have failed, no friends to turn away to"

"For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I‚Äôm not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I ‚Äúblew up‚Äù often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn‚Äôt feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent‚Äôs situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.
(READ LIST)

-------------------

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn‚Äôt. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.

**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**

* Arrogance

* Godlike feelings and delusions

Example: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):

&gt;I feel another late night coming up

&gt;See nobody understands

&gt;But you fo

&gt;Do

&gt;I'm a fucking genius

&gt;You know I was watching this show

&gt;This guy

&gt;He says

&gt;""I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.""

&gt;Great great quote

&gt;And I'm reading this book

&gt;On prioritizing what's important

&gt;There's so much for me to clear out

&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay

&gt;My paranoia's also back

&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do
	
&gt;I'm so fucking amazing

&gt;There's so mich

&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops

&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300

&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden

&gt;I'm going to get essay published

**Feeling out of touch with reality**

This one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this it‚Äôs as if my life is a movie, and I‚Äôm watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I can‚Äôt stop myself. It‚Äôs a strong feeling and loss of self control.

**Increased agitation**

Once again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. 

**Strange delusions**

This one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.

**Racing thoughts**

**Anxiety**

* Sick stomach feelings

* Shaky self

* Feeling of ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù mentally

**Work motivation**

* Feel the need to do a ton of work

**Increased mistakes**

As was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts that‚Äôs something I rarely do. For the past year or so I‚Äôve refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.

Example: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.

**Memory problems**

* Tend to forget things more

**Feeling disconnected from self**

I really need to write this one out. I‚Äôve been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know it‚Äôs me, I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs me. I feel as if I‚Äôm losing myself. I don‚Äôt really know how to put it, but I just feel like I‚Äôm not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm me. 

**Loss of hunger and appetite**

**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**

* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.

**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**

* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal

* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason

* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger

**Increased creativity**

====================

How this has impacted my life:

I‚Äôve been more sociable, more likable in a sense. I‚Äôve also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. I‚Äôve lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.

One time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling ""high""(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.

I‚Äôve lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I can‚Äôt control them. Once in an argument with my mom I‚Äôve said some things I regret.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.

-------------------

Downs:

**Apathy**

* Loss of interest in activities

* Lack of motivation to do anything, really

**Fatigue**

* Even after getting plenty of sleep

**Increased hunger and appetite**

* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger

**General feelings of hopelessness**

* Feeling like things don‚Äôt matter, like nothing matters

**Suicidal thoughts**

* Self explanatory, wanting to die

**Hatred for self**

* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well

**Loss of energy**

Most days I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.
Feelings and hope for nonexistence

Not exactly suicidal, but some days I didn‚Äôt want to exist in the first place. 

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Throughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasn‚Äôt keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didn‚Äôt really want to see anybody.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.

-------------------

Mix:

Twice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.

&gt;December 8

&gt;December 8

 &gt;I am not okay


&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months

&gt;The depression and the mild insanity

&gt;I‚Äôm filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I can‚Äôt and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I won‚Äôt

&gt;I swear I‚Äôm at war with myself right now

&gt;I‚Äôm isolating myself before I do something I will regret

&gt;I‚Äôve already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.

&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but I‚Äôm laughing and happy and crying inside

&gt;I‚Äôm not okay

&gt;I‚Äôm bouncing back and forth and I hate it

&gt;I want to do so much but I‚Äôm hollow

&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE

&gt;HELP

&gt;NOTHING HELPS 		

&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I can‚Äôt go downstairs I‚Äôm too unstable

The other time this happened I failed to record anything.

--------------------

To Conclude:

I‚Äôm not the kind to self diagnose myself, I don‚Äôt overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately I‚Äôve been searching around and researching what I‚Äôm feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what I‚Äôm feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything I‚Äôm feeling.

My mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I don‚Äôt think so, this just doesn‚Äôt feel right, even in my condition. I‚Äôve already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.

My father told me that I‚Äôm fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. I‚Äôve experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when I‚Äôm up, including mood swings, it‚Äôs all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

"A bit of background. There's this guy who I used to be great friends with in high school. Now we go to same college and we still have some of the same friends, but he's no longer in our main group of friends. 

I still talk to him from time to time, but we're not the ""talk everyday"" type of friends.

I was bored on Reddit recently so I decided to check his profile because he posts his own music and some stupid (in a good way) jokes sometimes, and I wanted to check it out.

I found his post here from a few weeks ago and I realized he broke up with his girlfriend, flunked a few classes, feels like he doesn't have anyone to talk to, and is really depressed h.

He didn't show up to a party we threw some time ago but we assumed that it was because of his grades. Now we found out he's going through issues.

We resolved to invite him to more stuff and reach out to him. We're also putting together a ""grades rehab crew"" to help tutor him next semester. What else can we do to help him through this?

For example, is it wise to ask people we know in his college block about the situation?

Do we tell him we saw his post?

I really wanna help my friend out. We would really appreciate your advice, reddit.

Here's his post for some more info.

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping.

Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). 

My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance.

So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way.

"A good while ago back in college, there was a guy who joined our friends group. Me and him had a lot in common, and while a number of us found him to be annoying, I stuck up for the guy. I told him about my past - my first love was a long distance relationship and when i went to visit her, it turned out to be nothing more than a huge joke on her end and that gave me trust issues.

Time moves on, we end up becoming roommates with another mutual friend. Eventually, introduced into my life is this other girl.  She's a bit of a depressed wreck, and given my past, her being into me as much as she was, made me a bit hesitant to label the relationship.  We slept together a number of times, and eventually my friend found out, much to my dislike.  They got along a bit TOO well for my liking, to the point where i told him that if he ever slept with her, it would end our friendship.

A couple weeks ago, i saw her leave his room and our apartment ever so casually without making eye contact with me. Knowing immediately what was up, I questioned him about it.  I went into his room, saw the condom, and what really, REALLY hammered in the betrayal, the breach of trust wasn't anything they did.  It wasn't the fact that something was important to me that he knew about and selectively ignored. 

It was the lying.

He's been tossed out of the apartment since, but he is coming back once winter break is over. But in this process, i'm done.
Earlier, i was an apathetical cynical wreck who no one cared about, but now I can't bring myself to trust anyone, even the other roommate.  My friend was the more outgoing of us, so of course he has more friends, but I can't involve myself with any of them, much less anyone else because I can't...trust them.  In one fell swoop, it feels like he's taken everything from me. 

I don't care for my job anymore. It's means to an end, and that end is a pretty pathetic life. I'm at the point where i'm done with everything, because as far as i'm concerned, I don't see anything positive anymore. ",4,"new guy in group, lot in comman, stuck up to this guy, opened up, trusted, betrayed trust, slept with girlfriend , no remorse, feel alone, donít care anymore"
"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.

"Hey Folks,

I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. 

The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. 

I think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives.

I moved out of home at 18, and now I'm 20. I live with my sister in a different state, because I used to get on with her. But now she has turned into a different person since I was hospitalised for depression and suicide attempts last year - I think it's because I am a reminder of the terrible and abusive childhood the children of my family experienced, and my sister is in denial about it effecting her. She is cruel and angry towards me. My whole family think I'm overreacting/lying because that is  what fits in with their denial.  
  
I was so desperate for some understanding that I booked flights back to my moms house for two weeks over the holidays. I'm one week in and my PTSD and anxiety have been getting progressively out of control since arriving. My family don't respect my personal space, they touch me unexpectedly which is a major fear for me and when I tell them I'd rather they didn't do that, they just laugh and keep going. Every time someone touches me I feel an overwhelming nausea and desire to cry or act violently towards them. Even my 4 year old niece, who I love and does not mean anything by her touches. I know they're trying to protect themselves by acting like my problems are not real, but I can't handle it. We all went through the abuse, why am I the only one facing it (and therefore suffering from it)?  
 
  
I have 6 days until my flight back home, and 1 day after that is my psychiatrist appointment, which I'm hanging out for. I feel like my greatest need is to be accepted into a different family, just for a year until I can get over the worst of this. My psychiatrist and my psychologist are my only friends and it sounds sad but that's how it is. I don't trust anyone else not to hurt me somehow.  
   
I don't know what to do. I'm so alone, and so overwhelmed. I'm trying not to be hurt by my family because they're just protecting themselves from reminders of the past. they will have to face the trauma at some point too. But I feel like I need to cut them off from my life completely for a few years until I'm stronger.  
  
I'm just so scared all the time here, so filled with dread and fear and anxiety. I want to have a family that loves me and listens. My own family is toxic, full of monsters and damaged people. I'm still just a little kid inside, and I'm not capable of doing this on my own. The trauma work with my psychiatrist is slow going because I'm so damaged, and react intensely to the slightest reminders. The nightmares have been constant this past week and I can't afford to change my flight home to sometime sooner.

"Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. 

Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. 

Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.

Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?

He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? 

I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?

My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. 

She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. 

I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.

TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.",4,"21 years old, parents very old, good job, promoted as youngets employee, travelled a lot , father diagnosed with cance, hospitalized, treatment stopped, 6-9 months given, worried about mother,mom a chain smoker, coing down with pneumonia, in a rut,"

This song is pretty much my theme song.

I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot.
Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands.

Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit.
I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace.
It fits in with usually how I feel.
If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless.
Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place.  I should have my vocal cords removed.

I thought I would be happier because I got a better job, but being lonely really sucks a lot more than I thought it would.

"I am 23 year old guy and for the past while I have felt totally lost and hopeless. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, and most days I think that I will never be happy again. Hating my life has become a usual thing for me and thoughts of killing myself are very frequently occurring now. Just want to vent a little and see if anyone has any advice at all for me. 

Social anxiety/generalized anxiety has affected my life for as long as I can remember. Self-confidence has always been an issue and has been a barrier in making friends/maintaining the few friendships I do manage to make. I have had periods in my life where I have had a close group of friends to spend time with but I never seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Most of those friends have gone on to make other meaningful relationships in their lives and I was not able to continue being a part of it with them.  On top of this, my family is currently pressuring me to find a girlfriend and get married but since I have not had any relationship with a woman in the past, I have no idea what to do and this is now adding to my anxiety (they tried to introduce me to some girls but I blew all of the chances from lack of experience). I constantly worry about the fact that I am a virgin and no woman is ever going to want me because of it and I also have issues with self-image (hate looking in the mirror sometimes). The loneliness turned me on to porn a long time ago and now I think I have an addiction; I am ashamed of this and feel hopeless because I can never talk to anyone about it out of embarrassment.  
Even for the less embarrassing problems, the 2 members of my immediate family are dealing with a lot of stressful problems of their own and I don't want to continue burdening them with my issues. 

Also, I am currently enrolled in a university program that requires a lot of social interaction when the only thing I feel like doing most days is isolating myself and staying in bed. I feel like the weird guy in my class because I just don't have the energy to socialize and make small talk and even when I do, my anxiety makes it so that I babble on like a fool. It is getting to the point where I am making excuses to explain my absences and I am afraid I am going to fail out of the program or succumb to the immense pressure by doing something irreversible. 

Basically, I hate myself and I just wish I could escape from being me for a while. Getting out of bed is becoming more and more of a chore everyday and I feel sad, ashamed, hopeless, and tired. I am pretty sure I am depressed but with my intense school program I just don't have the time to address my issues. Anyway, if anyone read my rant and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

"So I have clinical depression.  It's not super bad with meds, but it's always there and makes me perceive my situation as worse.  I basically live in the lap of luxury, with rich parents and an amazing acadmic school.  However, I am also extremely lazy.  I despise doing work and even though I'm pretty good at school (I'm a freshman in high school) I know I need to improve next year (first year at my school grades don't matter).  This is because I absolutely must get into Harvard.  All my siblings and both of my parents went there, and I would be a complete fuckup and embarassment if I didn't.  Perhaps it's irrational but it would be crushing to me, I might kill myself.  I have no friends at school, most people think I'm creepy (at the beginning I tried really hard to get a girlfriend and it backfired), overly pushy, annoying, etc.  My siblings, who I'm very close with, are rarely home, and I'm sort of the family problem child (they're all virtually perfect.)  My parents are usually good but they put me under a lot of pressure.  My life should feel good but I fucking hate it and I don't know how to handle 3 and a half more years of this with no friends, little sleep due to homework, boredom and stress.

"I'm sorry.

My entire life, until recently, I thought depression was merely another word for being sad.  I had thought it was just a feeling that would quickly go away.  I had thought that depression was something that was not a big deal, that it was more of a joke than anything. Whether it be society telling me that it wasn't serious or if it was just me being nieve; I need you to know I'm sorry I held these beliefs.

"Hello everyone.

I've never actually reached out about my wellbeing before and don't really know how to, so I guess I'm just going to lay it all out on the table.

I'm 24 and I graduated college about three weeks ago, and I think there may be some thing or things wrong with me that I was ignoring as I gritted my teeth through my generally painful and unrewarding five-and-a-half year college experience. To keep things abbreviated, all I'll say here is that during that short time I had three major medical catastrophes (one of which will persist for the rest of my life), I was stalked for 7 months at one point, lived with an abusive couple, and had several family deaths. All of these negative stimuli gave me the opportunity to hand-wave my mental health difficulties as par for the course. It almost goes without saying, but my GPA was decimated by these experiences (my college has a terrible medical withdrawal system and as a result I have never taken any medical leave).

I would say I was ""doing well"" during my last two semesters (although my definition of doing well still involves a constant fog of anxiety and sleep issues); I was pursuing my interests relatively aggressively, making probably a B+ average in my classes, exercising 3x/week (this stopped a couple months ago), etc. During my final semester I was even working two part time jobs while taking classes. I still had these constant discomforts that I chalked up to school and proximity to recent hardship, but now after a few weeks of unemployment and no school I'm starting to think I'm incapable of enjoying myself in a healthy way (or at all really).

I have diagnosed ADHD and have always struggled in school, but in the last three years have really had to teach myself how to learn and devote myself to my studies. As a result I have learned a lot, but I also have lost a lot of my sense of identity. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17, and have only been on one date in the intervening time. Additionally I have dropped essentially all of my hobbies, and my latent avoidant behaviors that have always subverted all of my efforts have become more and more disruptive. For instance, just tonight (it's 3:30AM where I live for context) I spent two and a half hours in my room while uncomfortably hungry in order to avoid interacting with my room mates (with whom I have no problems or stresses). After two hours of waiting, I compromised by grabbing a protein shaker and just walking to the kitchen while nobody was looking, rinsing it out, then making a protein shake with milk from my mini fridge in my room. It may seem like a silly example, but this kind of thing is reflected in every aspect of my life and I can't keep living this way.

For the last seven years (at least), I have also been bothered by a weird intrusive tick that I'm deeply ashamed of. I call it a tick, because it's not really a thought. It makes me cringe to even write it out, but for the longest time as I go about my daily forgettable tasks whenever I'm alone (or I'm at work and think I'm alone) I'll just mutter to myself some variation of ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm going to get out of here"", or ""I'm going to wake up."" It's a lot like a hiccup; it comes out quickly and unexpectedly to the point where I can't even stop it until halfway through the sentence, and even then it's like cutting off a stream of piss (it basically requires me to hold my breath in the middle of a sentence). One of my deepest fears is that someone I know will hear me saying these things one day, although at this point it seems almost impossible that nobody has yet. I've only told two people in my life about these things, and I consider both of those conversations a major life event; they were about four years apart.

All of these problems seem to worsen when my sleep is bad, and my sleep is always bad. I have utterly given up on being a well rested person and am a hostage to the vicious whims of my body clock. Now that I am not forced to wake up early, it's gotten even worse. I can't bring myself to even start projects that I'd been telling myself I was only putting off for school. I am hanging out with friends, but still constantly wonder why I am not doing more with my time, or at the very least actually enjoying myself in my leisure. School and work were hell, but free time is suffocating. I don't really understand why my life has come to be this way, but this seems to be the way that it is.

I'm worried that I might be about to enter (or maybe already in the midst of) a shame induced downward spiral. I'm not normally the type to do hard drugs, but in the last two and a half weeks I've dropped acid five times. This doesn't seem to be part of the problem however; I'm weirdly unaffected by these trips and am not having negative experiences from them (although I think I'm done for now). Simultaneously, my family is falling apart and my parents are talking about divorce over my sister's out of control decisions. Among my family and friends (most of whom also struggle with mild to serious mental instability), I am usually considered the one who ""has it together."" This is part of the reason that I have never sought professional help, along with a strong, quiet kind of discouragement of that sort of thing from my family and society as a whole.

From the day I finished my last exam I've felt this indescribable, seeping apathy. I don't know how it's possible to feel apathetic and panicked at the same time, but I seem to have pulled it off. Maybe it's more like paralysis. In any case, I can't seem to do anything constructive, I haven't been exercising, I haven't been looking for work (I applied for hundreds of jobs over the last semester), I have neither done anything stressful nor for even one minute felt relaxed. I'm always surprised when I am hungry, but if I really scrutinize my day will often find that I haven't eaten for 18+ hours. The worst thing is the underlying truth that nothing has changed and I was always like this. I can't believe I graduated at all.

I have enough money to last three months in my current living situation. In two weeks, I'm going to start applying to food service jobs. Although I have a BS in computer science, I feel that at this time in my life I am not cut out for a real job or really capable of contributing to anything, but I'm such a leech that I'll continue pursuing a career-type job while working in food service anyway.

**TLDR**

I guess I'll wrap up by saying what I meant to say in the first place: I'm worried about my life. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed something, and I am incapable of pursuing things that will make my life better. I'm afraid that my poor self esteem and self hatred will lead me to start making actively self-destructive decisions, and I don't really know where that path will end because I can't tell the difference between misery and happiness anymore. I don't know what to do about any of these things and honestly I can't see how posting this will help either, but I feel like I need to do something and I guess this is something.",3,"  3 major medical catastropes, mental health, stalked, abused, ADHD "

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

It resulted in a terrible night where everything made me anxious (more like paranoid) and with a clear mind I could comprehend it all more making me very down. Today I feel nauseous with no drive to do anything. I'm now wondering if the brain fog was some sort of coping mechanism. Other than that this has been my ""normal"" for a while so dose 4 is down.

Day 5: Down, anxious and not in the mood to do anything. Dose 5 taken.

Day 9: Not sure if anybody is still reading this but for time in a while I didn't feel sad yesterday. It was like it was still there but dampened down. I hope it stays, it's such a relief. Otherwise my insomnia is worse and I found I cared little about doing anything the last couple of days.

Day 14 - Final Update: These are definitely taking the edge off. I was thinking yesterday how badly I didn't want to go back to how I felt 2 weeks ago, that's a huge amount of progress. I've also realised there is no way these will work without therapy, so I've rebooked my cancelled appointments. Overall the tummy upset/nausea is gone, I feel more mentally alert, find it harder to sleep and have less physical energy. I also have moments where I don't care what I do then later care a lot. That's a bit odd but I feel better so I'm sticking with it for now.",3,"insomnia,anxious, dampened down"
"It's bad. I'm a quiet person. But now I'm realizing that the only times I'm not quiet revolve around times I'm talking about things that are depressing, like my depression or ptsd. It's like I have no sense of humor or have no personality other than that. I'm trying to build one now that I realize that, like develop interests and such, but it's a slow process and I've never ever been good at making friends. It's like, to make friends, I have to put myself out there, but when I put myself out there, I just suck at it. I am not present. I question in my mind, what do I say, does this sound stupid, and I hyper analyze my and the other persons reactions and what they say and do. It's ridiculous. I have no self esteem. 

I'm 27 now, just recently got approved for disability, and feel like a loser. I have a few ideas how to meet people and rebuild my life, like a local place that offers drop in support groups or meetup.com but I just feel so lost. I haven't graduated college and my boyfriend of two years just broke up with me, and my whole social support network revolved around him. I'm not used to being on my own.

"Hello!
This is my first post on Reddit. English is not my native tongue so bare with me.

My mom and dad molested me from 0-18 years old. My dad got me pregnant at the age of 11. We went abroad and I had an abortion. When I was younger (before I hit puberty) they sold me to other men and allowed them to use me as they pleased for a night, sometimes a whole weekend. 

At 18 I got a good job and moved far away from them. Now I'm 23 and my life is very good. I married the man of my dreams and together we have a 1 year old kid. I know I should be happy but I always feel depressed and anxious. I have flashbacks everyday and nightmares every night. 

I'm starting a ptsd program with a therapist tomorrow and to be honest I don't want to go - I'm really scared. I don't know what will happen when I start talking about everything that happened when I was a kid.
I feel like my childhood was just too messed up and I will never get over it. I'm so tired of the flashbacks and the nightmares. I have too many bad memories. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. 

Do you think I can get over this and be normal?

Hey, everyone. 


I understand that in the past year or so, I've been pretty distant and non-communicative in person and over the Internet. This is no fault of your own, and I'm not a smug elitist bastard - or, at least, I try to avoid being that. For a long time, I've been afflicted with depression and it's affected every area of my life. It might seem obvious to a few of you, but even then, it's so scary to admit it. I'm afraid no one is going to give a shit, or think that I'm looking for dramatic attention. Hell, it's just a bad idea to come forth, because no one wants to deal with that kind of additional stress. I've lost or damaged relationships in the past trying to get people to understand, but all I did was bring them down with me, drowning them in the details. 


It's not an excuse for me to be a shitty friend, though, and it's definitely not a good idea to let it manifest in cutting people out - people that have supported me, that I've had good times with. I don't expect your sympathy, trust, support, or understanding, even. I just want to be a better person for you all. 


I imagined how other people would imagine their own funeral. Maybe you want a dramatic crowd, maybe you want your intimate friends and family surrounding your casket. It scares me to think I might have zero people around to remember me as someone worthy of being called a friend, or worthy of sharing a bloodline and a name. It scares me to think that the only recollection someone might have of me is a two sentence tidbit, and not a pleasant one at that. So I'm sorry. I'll be better. Tell me if I'm not, and if you could so kindly give me advice to be a better person along the way, you have my gratitude. If you want to talk or message me, let's catch up. 


P.S. If you post some unfunny ""crippling depression"" meme in response, then I'll have zero remorse actually cutting you off.",5,"depression , drive people away, shitty friend to people, stess, lost damaged relationshops"

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

Well,at least she is happy,fuck I want to die.

Oh yeah,I also had to lie to my parents that I was doing fine for my first day,since I know they wouldn't do shit,Fuck yes,Back to school is fun,everybody!",5,"thought school was hell, holidays were were super depressed, desparate to go school, sat alone in class, no one caes, the girl I  like does not acknowlege existance"

Maybe I am a failure and maybe I never will amount to anything, but how will I know if I never try or believe in myself. I will use my nihilism to succeed and be happy. This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me.

not cooking, not eating that well, but better.
not drinking water.
hopeless.
I beat myself up daily.

"This post is a mess. I don't care about structuring; I just typed in the words as they came to me... sorry for the mess...

---

I've been thinking about this for a while... then again, I stay in bed or sleep through most of the days, so I have a lot of time to think.

I talked to one of my friends (an increasingly rare species) last night and it got me to think.

I can't help anyone. As much as they keep saying things like how kind I am to them (""dude... if you really just said that, then you're not paying attention"") how good I am at listening, how much I helped (with what?)... nobody comes to me anymore when things happen. Unless I ask first, but by that time the damage is already done or they are already out of it.

So this friend and I talked and we talked for hours. Things got emotional at some points and eventually I just said ""Thank you for trusting me, but please, for your own sake, don't... you may come to me for help one day, on a day when I'm sick of being alive, and I will hurt you. I will makes things worse for you.""
Did I just say that? Really? Damn you, Bluerain12ya, what the hell are you doing?!?!

It hurt me. I'm on the verge of crying as I'm typing this and I don't know anymore what I'm supposed to do. Why am I even here? Why am I alive?

My mum recently told me about her depression which I knew nothing about. I didn't know how to react...
My crush was hospitalised due to a failed suicide attempt and despite how much we talked and helped each other in the past, she went to that other friend I talked to last night. I didn't even have the chance to help her. People who know about my depression, my medication, my self harm stopped talking to me. Sure we talk when I meet them, or if I message first, but for them to come to me first?
Hell, they are probably right. I'd just let them down anyway...

The only person I do talk on a semi-daily basis is someone I've met on r/selfharmpics
I have my doubts if I should message her any more, or rather if she should come to me and trust me with her problems. Every time I say something positive, every time I try to help, I feel like the biggest damn hypocrite on the planet. But I'm mostly worried that, especially recently, I just put my worthlessness for her to deal with, my constant whining, and I end up hurting her more than the suffering she already has to deal with. But I promised her, that I will not leave, I won't push her away and I won't let her push me away. That I might keep my distance if she needs it, but I will always be close enough to reach me. But I'm terrified that I'm just making things worse!!!

And I tried. I though if I try to help others, maybe I can take my mind off of things, and if they feel better, than I feel better, too. But I can't. And nobody wants to come to me. Nobody should come to me, anyway, since now I realise that I'll just be worthless... I'll just end up hurting them even more.

It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. 

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. 

I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. 

This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel.

I don't always agree with myself thow and sometimes contradict myself in weird ways. my subconscious will be scared but I won't be scared. that doesn't make sense. I will talk and act one way but then the next day act as if I am someone else.



ussually Iignore myself but my subconscious (I nicknamed it sub so I will refere to it as that) tells me to stop. this is hard to explain so if you want to know more you can ask but for now I am going to move on.


I don't think I am that good of a person, I have a strange desire ti physically and/or mentally hurt others. I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing (I draw alot of violence) but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away.



I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others. I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted. 

I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable. I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason.



I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this. I lack motivation even to do things I like.I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily.

I'm messing up in school, I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it.

I feel like a big waste of time.

"Today I gave up.

 Just got back the results after retaking a test and scored another F. And so I am formally announcing giving up on my education and getting a low-entry job and just being content with that for the rest of my life. I've been depressed for a while now, and self-medicating with alcohol. Somedays just seem to pass on autopilot, I don't even notice the day has passed until I look outside and see it's already dark out.

So I'm back to jobseeking once again, and experiencing incredible anxiety about telling my family about my failure, they've been really supportive of me ""taking life into my own hands"" and striving to do better with my education. Truth be told it was a half-assed attempt and I barely studied at all. Spent my time playing games or wallowing in self pity most of the time.

Yesterday I googled something that vaguely described how I felt and landed on [this page](http://www.getesteem.com/lse-symptoms/symptom-details.html) and it resonated so hard with me I broke down into tears. I feel like a mess.

Everything is just really overwhelming right now.

"Hi everyone,
I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts.

The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer.

However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called ""anticipatory"" anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.

Thanks in advance!

"My teacher asked me if I was suicidal. Without any preliminary. I answered nope while swearing inside. It's so annoying. Then she told me I must feel miserable and pain all the time, I am a brave fighter. Well, I would have felt more miserable or annoying , but since she'd expressed her sincere sympathy in that way too much times, I've become used to it.
""So there must be something or someone supporting me."" , she said. To this I answered nope again.
She seemed felt ambivalent, she asked me, "" if that's so then why you're sill alive. ""
Oh, tbh despite everything that's an interesting question  because I really can't come up with a good reason at first. I have no real friends. I feel lonely all the way, but I would be disturbed if someone talked to me. So technically I don't want someone keeps me company even though I feel lonely.

"Hello everyone, first time in this subreddit, not really sure though if this is a right one to tell my problem, so excuse me if it isn't.
Don't really know where to start. Thought what I wanted to write and it flowed like water in my head but it is a little harder to organize it properly here, so I will try to explain my situation as best I can.

Long text ahead.

I am generally a closed person, 25yo male, I have a few friends and some of them are really good. I can't make friends easily nor hold proper a conversation when meeting a stranger. I ussually cut it off quickly, especially with a woman and it feels to me that I act like I am in a hurry and it usually feels I don't really care about what they have to tell me about themselves and act like that, whether it's a man or woman. I am not impolite or anything like that, i just can't keep the conversation flowing. Sometimes when I consiously want to talk with acquaintances or try to meet someone new, I just don't know what to say, usually in this case because I don't want to insult them somehow and I end up not saying anything or very few, resulting sometimes in akward silences.

I just started on a temporary work 3 months ago moved from my small hometown to a big city. It took me, I think a lot of time to start getting comfortable around my coworkers (as most times). All of them seem funny, good and open people that won't get offended by anything I would say, either to get to know them better or just to make some fun on our break. But they are not really the case on why I am writing this.

My problem mostly lies after my work on me socializing with other people. I generally enjoy sitting alone in my house, spending time in the copmuter mostly, or doing the daily chores and a little exercising. I used to live with my parents before getting the job and I hated being in the house with them (I want to mention here that I don't hate my parents at all, I love them and respect them very much). Spent my time closed in my room on my computer, or outside with the friends I have in my hometown. Which are all male by the way and the closest I have. The few rest that I have in the city that I work are mostly old friends from when I was young that we just kept in touch. Nothing more.

As I see other people in the streets with girlfriends or even being friends with them and I am kind jealous, not in that specific person I see, but on the general relationships that I whitness. I beat my head on how to find a solution on this, but whenever I am invited from some of the friends I have here, I am generally too bored to go out with them and prefer to stay alone. I mostly am bored to go out with them, because they are male friends as well, as I don't know any of their girl friends that hang with. Even if there would be girls in that company, I still propably wouldn't go because of the reasons I described earlier. I would be too bored to get to know them or just wouldn't know what to say, staying completelly passive. I feel kinda sad to myself when I get to take some long walks in the city where I see all these people socializing having relationships. But when I get in the silence if my home, 99% of the times that feeling just goes away

(Kinda TL;DR) I am in a situation where I am content that I stay alone in my house, where I have peace of mind and without having to act fake to talk with people. BUT I also want to find a girlfriend, to try to hang out with the friends that I have here and maybe meet some new, either through my friends or through work but I find it completelly boring/tiring to get in the process to do all that and I just prefer to stay home in the end.

"The thought only came to me after a dream i had last night.  I was John Constantine (a DC comics magician who has a history of screwing over demons) and I got caught by a demon.

Yet yesterday and today, in my waking life, I felt/feel significantly depressed with no such hope.

"On Christmas night my boyfriend of two years broke up with me over text message. I didn't quite figure out what he was saying until the next morning.

We had gotten into an argument because he felt that I wasn't paying attention to him. I disagree. I was paying attention to him. Of course my six year old sister was going to act more excited to see him than a I do on an average day. He's a novelty to her. She thinks he's awesome. She loves when people just exist. She's six. And I made an error with the time that I went to his house, so we only got an hour and a half rather than the two hours I planned for. When we got to my house, he didn't make any effort to do Christmas dinner stuff with me or talk to me. And then he was mad at me for not spending that hour with him when he didn't try spending the hour with me. I tried. I tried to make everything fucking perfect. I was nervous. His family does Christmas differently. This was my chance to show him my traditions and we'd mix our traditions together in our future. I felt like we didn't get to be together much, so I invited him to help my sister try out her telescope. Apparently he didn't want to, but there was no communication. He didn't say anything. I sent my sister inside when we couldn't figure out how to use the telescope. He wouldn't come inside. He quiet-whisper-yelled ""no"" when I asked if he wanted to go inside. He told me that he never wanted to go outside. That I had been ignoring him all day/night. I don't remember everything that I said, but after he accusingly told me that my sister seemed more excited to see me then I have in a long time, I got angry. I told him that he could either come inside or stay outside. His choice.

When I came back outside after composing myself a bit, he was gone. The gift from my parents were sitting on the front steps and he was gone. I was terrified. I am terrified of people just leaving and disappearing without a trace. And he did just that. I texted him to ask where he was while trying to quell the rising panic. He could get hit by a car or get sick from the cold or just completely vanish forever. He replied that he was a good distance down the road. I panicked for a moment while formulating a plan. I went inside and grabbed my keys. I was going to tell my parents and grandparents that I'd be back, but they seemed so happy. I could totally handle this on my own while everything was falling apart.

I drove to the intersection and pulled into an empty parking lot nearby and got out. He was across the street and I wouldn't be able to safely cross right away, so I screamed his name. I'm not really the kind of person to scream, but I was angry and hurt and still panicking. I don't remember everything I said on the drive to his house. I did tell him that no matter how angry I was in previous arguments that I have never and would never just walk away like that. I told him that I wanted to in one, but I purposely left my purse and maybe my shoes so that I couldn't make a rash decision out of anger.

When we parted, he said, ""Over next few days, you should think about whether we should keep fighting for us or not,"" which I responded to with, ""Are you going to?"" I guess I heard it in a condescending way or something. He said of course. He said ""I still love you"" and I told him the same. Then he went into his house and I left and went home absolutely destroyed. I cried a tiny bit, but it wasn't hitting me. Then I got home and saw that my grandparents had just left and I was just devastated. When I came inside I cried into my stepmom's lap for like, ever. When I looked at my phone to say goodnight and send my love, I saw the following...

""I'm sorry the night had to end that way.""

""We're two totally different people and we don't seem to work well together. All we do is hurt each other anymore and it's getting to be draining. I need to get better and you need to get better and we spend too much time working against each other. I'm sorry. I tried. And you did, too. It's time to focus on ourselves.""

And that was sent at 9:15. I got home around 8 or 8:30. It felt like he had already decided early on. That wasn't the couple of days. It was barely an hour.

He then unfriended me and my family on Facebook. This was like, the 27th. We officially broke up on the 26th, I guess.

I don't know if I forgive him. I don't think that I do. I feel like he put the entire night being fucked up on me. Like I should have done better. And I usually tell myself that. I usually tell myself that I should have done this or that. But not this time.

I don't know how to move on or push through or whatever. I miss him and I still love him and I don't want him out of my life forever. I've never been so heartbroken. I feel empty and I am depressed. I've always gone to him. I trusted him. I'm telling myself that now he can go find someone who isn't stupid. Someone who isn't afraid of intimacy. I don't know, someone better. Maybe he wants to just forget about me with my fucked up brain and chemical imbalances and mood disorder like everyone else should. I don't know what to do and I'm really trying to just be happy but I can't. I barely got through New Year's Eve. I tried using positive images to get to sleep last night because I couldn't sleep, but all I could think of was love and how I was a fucking idiot to think that I'd ever find it. Why did I let myself feel?

I know that our relationship was very unhealthy, but I don't want it to be over. ",4,"boyfriend of 2 yeas broke up on christmas evening, blamed me of ignoring, disappeared and vanished"
"I always enjoy having non serious debates with people because it is a good way to understand how people think. When I was having the debate with my friend, my friend's argument was not clear, so I kept questioning, but she gave me the same answer over and over again. We decided to just end it because it was going no where. I later said (texted), ""we should continue tomorrow, it was fun."" I still had things to say but just wanted to come off as fun and light-hearted so that this debate will go on. She started attacking the way I'm acting and my personality ( which was related to the argument ) and said I started getting angry when she started aggressively texted me. She has a tendency to purposely anger me many times, however sometimes she takes it too far and doesn't realizes. I even told her after that I didn't like when she did it but she still acted like a sarcastic asshole to me. It just made me really angry and annoyed and I just feel like punching something or inflict pain on myself to feel better. 4Am I overreacting?

"This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change.

"Maybe I am exagerating, maybe I complain too much? maybe I give up too soon? I dont know if I should feel bad feeling BAD for something not THAT BAD? when there are worse people in the world? I dont know, what I do know is that I am tired of this.

I am a master student (yea fuck me right?) I am studying a master in economics with an scolarship I won to Europe (lol right) I do not even know how I got this scolarship, my grades were not that good at the university where I struggled all the time for being the best, but never was. I worked for 2 and half years in a bank, I never EVER knew what to do, what what my work assingment was, and whenever I asked my supervisor for directions I ended up more confused and never dared to ask again the SAME GODAMN question because it is annoying I feell into this trap all the time. It was deppressing, my supervisor used to call me worried about my situation I was all the time the last one delivering work assingments, was changed of department becauase of my low productivity. etc

After that nightmare ended, I came here to Europe to study, a new begining, no it was not like that, I still have the same problems, and discovered MANY MORE, i am not organized, (nor do I know how to be organized) I do not know how to manage my time, I do not understand the more practical assignments such as econometrics, I do not know how to write a fucking paper, everybody does, everybody understands, I am socially arkward, I dissapear into the people talking, I am not handsome, I hate my body.

I want to end my life, I reallly want to end it all right here, but if it were not because of my parents, my 2 friends and my SO i would not be here. I am affraid of cause pain to them. But I cannot stand it, I hate being the shitty stupid good for nothing kid, during this master I have left classes, got bad grades, and as usual, the last in the class in terms of perfomance or reliability.

why? Why does it happen to me? I really struggle to be better at what I do (I must admit I do not like my career) but no results? I really struggle to understand concepts, theory, processes, but no avail. I do not get better, and it hurts, it hurts to try it one more time, I am affraid to be dissapointed of myself again, I am affraid of feeling that sensation of not being to do something. I dont want to feel like a failure anymore I just want to stop existing.

"I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. 

In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.


I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.
I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'
I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.
But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!


I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)

Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.
Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.


I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.


I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.
I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)
I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.


For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.
My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.
In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.

I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)
I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.

"I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.


The abridged version of my life:
================
As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.

My parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.

High school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.

In spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.

At 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.

Eventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.

Went on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.

Started dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.

We would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.

After his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. 

Moved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.

Best friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.

Had a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.

I am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.

I've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.


*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. 


Current thoughts
==============
I don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. 

I'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.

I've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. 


Some problems I have
==============
*Moody

*Typically pretty tense

*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times

*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated

*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)

*Memory is worsening

*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together

*Sleep not restful

*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong 

*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting 

*Sometimes experience anhedonia

*ADHD may be related

*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",1,"grew up in conservative environment, bullied for being effiminate, mocked for androgynous growing, parents figth, no friends, current partner emotionally unavailable"
"Sometimes I feel bad because my depression is not as bad as some people who commit suicide or live in constant agony. Even posting this was hard because I thought people with ""real"" depression should be helped first. 

I have been in and out of depression for the last 10 years. Mostly bouncing between deep apathy where I didn't care about anything and extreme joy and euphoria in  3 month cycles. It all ended about a year ago when instead of apathy and numbness I felt deep sorrow, sadness and grief and got stuck there. No more numbness or euphoria just always feeling sad and wanting to cry but not being able to. Also feeling like there is no hope in regards to any aspect of my life. I almost never leave home in the last 2-3 month except to get food and run errands, luckily I work from home and I really avoid all human contact except my girlfriend. I even stopped responding to calls/texts from friends because I feel like no one really understands what I'm going through and everyone just wants to say ""ohh toughen up, life's hard, get your shit together, stop feeling mopy"".  My work is suffering since I cant really concentrate on it and Im worried I might loose it. I feel deep shame and regret because I achieved nothing in the last 10 years of my life (my 20s) nor did I have any fun most of my peers had. 

I feel like I cant go on like this because its a horrible place to be stuck in and I want to seek help but I am confused where to start. 

Should I looks for a psychologist or psychiatrist ? I dont have suicidal thoughts I'm just really scared I will live like this for the rest of my life. Is my condition psychological or physiological ? Is there a test to take ? I'm really against anti depressants due to the scary side effects but I'm opening up to the idea slowly if I know 100% that that's he only way for me to get better. 

Are there any resources I should check out ? I really dont know where to start. I appreciate any help I can get.

"I have a difficult life but I wouldn't say it's the worst or even that terrible. But I still live in such unending unbearable pain everyday.

Back at the end of October I had a near break down. I was just short of collapsing on the ground crying, but I was at work and held it together well enough to quit my job in professional manner. Nearly walked off the job as well, instead I talked to my work crew and got off early.  Why did I quit? Well they weren't paying me correctly for my job and hours and pay rates for 4 months straight. I had run out of patience. 

My dad is so sick he is currently living in the hospital. I mean we emptied his place and gave notice. And I take care of him. 

I have a lump in my breast. I'm cancer free thankfully, but it's still painful and keeps me from going back to work. It feels like a red hot poker beneath my skin when I get too active. (Sweeping the floor too fast is too active) 

My mom's health is deteriorating and her attitude is ""whatever""

There is no one to help me look after my dad because no one likes him, not even me. I can't stand the asshole. He throws his urinals at the nurses! 

My oldest brother has heart problems 

My middle brother doesn't act like he cares about family but his friends have out right called me a liar.

I can't handle life. I just can't. I try and ask for help and I get no where.

I could write a book on all that's bothering me. But it's this depression that is killing me. And when I'm feeling ""better"" I really fear that in my low moments I might actually kill myself. I live with suicidal thoughts at any given moment of the day. I can be laughing with someone then as soon as the smile fades I'm back to thinking about killing myself. Most mornings those suicidal feelings are so intense that I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I get out of bed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/

But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. 

Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it.

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I don‚Äôt remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I don‚Äôt know anywhere else to turn to.

This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care.

"You promised to never leave me, literally a day before you left. You promised me you loved me no matter how much I bugged you and asked you over and over if you really did. You wanted to spend Christmas with me, yet a day later you left me. 

You promised you'd stay. You were mine and I was yours. You were always my one to talk to, my only one to talk to. The only one I could be myself around, the only one I've ever loved. For once in my life I didn't feel this horrible feeling I never wanted to come back.

I'm nothing but a distant bad memory to you, and the most you wanted from me in the end was pleasure. How fucking dare you. We haven't talked in 3 days, It's killing me inside. The most we have ever not talked in over a year.

As many letters or messages I write to you, to Reddit, or to even myself you will never want me. I will always want you, desperate for even just a message from you. I want you to miss me and love me again. It's all I will ever want.

You wanted me for so long, you fought for us, you wanted me. I'm guessing it's my fault. I wore you down, I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry to myself for making us end up like this. I love you so fucking much. You took money from me, oh well right? Too bad that money was worth more than I ever was. I will forever regret trusting you, maybe we would still be together.

I want the pain to stop. I want you to get out of my mind. I want you so badly and it's eating away at me. I will never get better. I never want another guy to love me or to care about me just to leave me like that. I never want to get hurt again like this.

"First of all I just need to get this out of my body, you dont have to read it or reply.

To begin with this was really horrible month for me. 
Besides all my bad emotions I can still actually enjoy things, still do something. I met a girl, she is really interesting and cares about me, you know that goth girl into David Bowie and Oasis era, freeminded smart and everything. I kinda needed this, someone who would fullfill my desires and bring te burried passions from me. I WANT TO LIKE HER, but my mind keeps tellin me its not enough like i dont need it, all my mind cares about is pleassure, to feel god. This relationship kills me. She likes my hair, but I am losing one side which makes me totally depressed I can't even count things i avoided because of it, keep checking if another fall, keep looking at them. I am also really skinny and my pose sucks so hard i hope she doesnt care... She invited me like before Christmas to sleepover oh boy i was so glad even i wasnt thinking we could have together something, I mean its awesome to drink a bit and spent nigh with someone you like watch movies listen to music and stuffs. We got kinda drunk and she asked me to kiss her so i did, I didnt need to have sex with her even I kinda wanted to try it for first time but it was ok, i just took of her bra and we had great time.

Next day i was happiest human on earth, trust me, pure euphoria. but i started overthinking it which was a huge mistake I mean we was drunk. I met her today again to make it clear for my mind I think she again enjoyed time spend with me then we kissed and It actually felt again good kinda weird but good... anyway i was depressed, melanholic and tired from everything i wasnt able to enjoy it. She cares about me, she likes me but i dont really think I am able to.

Drugs. I smoke for 1,5 to compress somehow everything, i know its bad i hate myself for it. I tried to stop few times but i felt like it wasnt me, i didnt feel addicted i jsut felt dead inside. Ive been drinking sometimes with friends and hell its so good, i still think about being drunk because its so good feel and that scares the shiit out of me jesus i am afraid, really afraid. We used to in this cold make firecamp drink and chill and trust me, those were best days ive ever head, spent time with people i like people who likes me and know me.. i never felt more happy than this birthday (turned 17 this motnh) cause we enyojed it together.

I was never like most of people (not into way am different) I had not like favourite sport i did long time, i have not hobbies, interests... ive never felt blithely. All i do is listen to music and surf net. I feel like i know every good band and i am afraid i wont find another :( 
Ive got bad grades, my parents and grandparent hates me for that. I hate myself for that but with my status i cant do anything, trust me. My best friend is lazy and addicted to weed, other i dont like that much and they are also lazy, well im too but i wish i could enjoy myself more. do stuffs, see shits.
I wish i was able to work and make some money but im too psychicaly exhausted its impossible.

I feel ill, do i need a help? I cant describe how i feel, its horrible..i sometiems fantazire about killing myself, i wouldnt do it, but i FUCKIN WISH I KNEW how it feels to be dead. ANYTHING than this really.

Also my grandfather died who i never liked, all he cared about was my grades. My mom woke me up with this massage and i didnt feel a bit sad, I felt empathy for parents and grandma but nothing else... it destroys me i have to write this but my mind was thinking about stuffs he left so i could get it. That day we had after christmas lunch and all they were talking about was funeral and how I should learn and learn things to avoid bad stuffs. From that time my mind got seed that like when i grow older i wil jsut piss out of family and forget on everything.

In my senior year of high school I went through my worst and only other breakup. For almost a year she cheated on me and only told me after she felt guilty enough to do so.

According to my ex I'm doing nothing to better myself because I'm content making the money that I am, I'm okay being financially comfortable instead of wanting to be filthy fucking rich. I have no debt at all and have a sizable savings and putting money towards a retirement. But I'm a lazy asshole because I'm not working towards something bigger. 

It's starting to affect my work life. I barely have a social life. I'm always down and no one wants to be around that. I try to be polite but I'm sure it comes across as disingenuous. I don't even know how to meet people or pretend to be happy enough to try. 

Please excuse my ranting.

The point is, I need to do something. I don't know what. I tried therapy before and it was awful.

"So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients.

"I am so lonely that its depressing me. I've been lonely for my whole life and I never really noticed it but around August of 2016 I got put in a team for a teamwork project I had for uni. There I met this girl and we started chatting. It was wonderful. We were basically inseparable. We were sending selfies and stuff and chatting all the time almost every day. We met irl(she lives in another town) and we both had loads of fun. 

This continued for some time and then something happened... She stopped chatting to me like we used to. She told me that she had some problems and stuff. We still chat but I really dont know how to describe it. Our conversations dont last as much as they used to and dont happen that often in general. I really got attached to her. And I really like her. But too shy to tell her how I really feel. 

She showed me what it feels like not be lonely and I really miss that feeling. I have almost no friends its only her and one childhood friend.

And now I am sitting alone at home. Everyday is the same thing. I sit at home in bed and sometimes go on my computer. And this repetitiveness of my life is really depressing me. I dont have a job yet. I will be at home for the rest of January.  I dont know how I can do anything productive when there is a massive hole in me. And some might say why dont I just go out and socialize. Well its not that easy for me. I am a very shy person and its tough for me to talk to somebody. I am just awkward. 

I just dont want a lonely boring life. 

I know that others have it worse. I wrote this just to share my story and hopefully feel better by doing so.

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. 

I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that.

"After years of different therapies, tens of therapists, the usage of nearly all anti-depressants, support groups, pursuing hobbies and practicing mindfulness etc etc...

What if I am just not meant to get better? What if it is impossible? 

My reasoning for thinking this is that what if my brain, on an evolutionary level, was simply not made to cope with all this stuff? Of course many centuries ago it really was survival of the fittest. If you were weak (mentally or physically) - you died. Nowadays with all these therapies and medications, I feel as if it is messing with my brain as it doesn't know how to cope with everything that happens and the medications that affect it.

I know that brains have the ability to evolve and change its mind paths through neuroplasticity I just feel as if it is impossible in this case.

"It's 01:12am right now.

I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me.

Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve.

Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me.

"I've been with depression for about a year now and right now I think I am at my worst. The thoughts of ending it all are going through my head more than I've ever had it before and it's because I have a solution to my pain but that solution will only cause more pain for me in a different way. I don't know what to do and I feel like I need some help. 

My decision revolves around my religion. I am a member of the LDS church and have been all my life. I was raised with it and I believed in it to the full extent. However nowadays church is a pain to go to and anything having to do with god is like a pin prodding at me. Church has turned into a shaming session where when I do go I hear the speakers talk about certain things and I always come to the decision that they are talking to me and pointing out what I should be doing. Even in Sunday school I feel like that's happening. So to avoid this I go to church and play on my phone the whole time which is not the point of being their in the first place. So I feel like I go and ruin the next couple days for myself or I go and feel like a rude asshole for not paying attention when I'm in class or in sacrament. 

So the solution to this problem is obviously just not going but I fear that the things that will come of that will destroy me and my family even more. My dad is very connected to the religion and heir already seeing my falling away and I can tell he's disappointed. I feel like I'm failing him and that leaving will only make it worse. Not only that is there my brother who is unstable and has anger and control issues who I think that if I leave he will follow. That is not what he needs and I think the church is the best thing for him so the idea of him leaving is not something I want to see happen. Not only that but if he leaves my father will probably be even more disappointed not only for me But for my brother. 

I need to come to a decision here but both options are awful. I can either be selfish and leave while ruining my family in the process or stay and endure my pain and hatred of myself for the rest of my life. I have lost hope in myself and hopefully you guys have some idea what to do cause I'm sitting in bed crying over this situation.

"Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there.

"So, my husband (25) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and put on meds at age 11. He hardly knows life without depression. Aside from a few isolated episodes, it's been mostly under control. He's not suicidal or super moody, but he's not living life to the fullest either. He's just...there.

For the last few months, he's been unemployed, still trying to find a solid career. No degree past high school, hoping to get into bookkeeping (trying to take the learn by doing route). Luckily, we get by just fine on my income alone, but I still want him to find a career or something fulfilling to do outside of the home. 

I'd understand if there just weren't any jobs out there (but the job market is pretty good where we live), but we both know full well that he's not putting in sufficient effort to get a job in a timely manner. So at the very least I expect him to be helpful around the apartment, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Or at least try developing a routine so he can feel better (regular exercise, good diet, meditation, structure, etc.) But it's a struggle for him to even do that. He's just constantly drained.

I understand that this comes with the depression package. But I am still conflicted. I'm trying my best to be patient and non-judgmental. But I have a hard time telling if it's his own dang fault, or if it's depression that he can't help. I don't know whether to be angry or compassionate. Is there any way to tell the difference? I fear bringing this up with him too often for fear of making him feel even worse about himself.

Also, I understand that with the current state of depression medication, there is no cure, only things to make depression bearable. We're also apprehensive about changing meds too much since that can bring on a lot of emotional turmoil in the weeks it takes for the new medication to work. But how do you know or judge what is an acceptable level of functioning and what's unacceptable (and calls for a prescription change, therapy, etc)?

TLDR: At what point do you see a therapist/psychiatrist? How much depression (after meds and such) is acceptable? And how do I as his spouse strike a balance between pushing him to be better and being supportive?

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. 

So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications?

The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"I was a loser's loser. I was 20 years old, never kissed a girl, weighed almost 270 pounds, got arrested twice, and almost flunked out of my major in school. 

The 2nd arrest was the last straw. I hit rock bottom and I was so embarrassed. In literally ONE SUMMER, I hit the gym every day, lost over 65 pounds and saw a therapist. When I got back to college, I got a 3.9 GPA the first semester back. I also figured out a way to be popular with the ladies, finally having a real sex life and I got a long-term girlfriend (today I've slept with about 15 women, a feat that previously seemed impossible). I was amazed by my hard work and success, I truly felt like I was on top of the world.

Unfortunately, the girl ended up ruining my life. She thoroughly mistreated me, and I took everything she threw at me because I was just so thankful for the attention. She got a job in a new city, and I decided to get a job there too so that we could begin our life together after college. Unfortunately, said girl went to Mexico on Spring Break and cheated on me before I ever even moved. But, I got a great job, and I decided to make a go of it.

Now, I'm almost 24 and since I made this move, the depression has been back with a vengeance. I can't shake this feeling of inadequacy because I let this girl walk all over me, and now because I moved for her, I still have to deal with this breakup even though it's about 1.5 years later.

-Meds are not an option- I have been on them and they have negatively affected my health so had to quit (blood pressure and weight on various types).

-I have anxiety with depressive episodes (but no mania). Not bi-polar, no clear ""type"". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.

-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).

-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).


&amp;nbsp;


Please provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).

"Title. Just felt like punching shit while I was in the car on the way back, just wanted to lose control but I didn't. Felt like cutting, going back to the drugs I just got free from, felt like just going back to my old self, just wanna shut myself away. Why does this shit affect me so much. Guess it's just cause it should be easy yet I can't not fail at least once first. Same happened with my permit, I failed the first time and felt worse then than I do now. Guess it's the embarrassment, my family didn't think I would pass anyway, they said they did but I could tell. My friend told me it'd be fine cause it's **easy** so I'd do fine, so where does that leave me. Just makes me feel stupid. I can't retake it for like 3 fucking months either cause I'm going back to school soon. Hopefully this doesnt come up when I'm there, less I talk to people less chance it will happen right, that's just how it is with everything tho.

"Side story:
I am never been diagnosed. However, I always remembered back when I was a child that I had some happy moments, but really sad times too. Until I started school at the age of 6, I was always feeling sad and alone. I was bullied often. 
Three years ago, my mom tried to kill herself. She had undiagnosed depression and had been living with it for years. We got her help. We all blamed the depression on her mother that abused her as a child. She is now on antidepressants and is learning to cope with it. 

I'm now 30 years old. I moved to a middle eastern country for work. Been here for 3 years now. I am a huge mess. I have never felt so alone before. I don't have any will to do anything besides just work. I have no family here for support.  I do have 'friends', but they will not understand nor will they really bother to care.  I know that I need help, but in this country, I'm too scared to seek for help. I don't want to end up like my mom. I know I should be grateful for all I have and all the opportunity that life has given me. I should not be selfish, but I still feel dead inside. 
I wish I can move back home... but I will come back as a failure. I won't be able to get any respectable job. My parents would be disappointed in me. I don't want to tell them how I really feel because they will feel like it is their failure as parents that I am this way. They worry too much and I want them to believe that I am happy. 

What the hell am I even saying anymore? 

Point: I know I need help. I have no one to support me. I'm scared to admit to someone I know that I have a problem. I can't go home. I have to make this job a success. 

So i ask: What was the first step you took to get help?  
How did you overcome the fear of being stereotyped? 

Thank you...",4,"mom had undiagnosed depression, she tried to kill her self, feel alone , have friends who donít support me, cant move back home"
"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry.

"Hey guys.
I have been a long time lurker of this sub but have been to nervous/anxious to post anything. I apologize for my rambling, its been a long couple days. 

Honestly it's really hard for me to accept that I need help and can't ""help myself"". My family has a looonngggg history of mental health issues, I always thought ""I was the exception"", shit everyone else thought so too. My sister is bipolar, OCD, struggles with manic depression as does my mom. My brother unfortunately lost his fight with depression a few years ago. Actually, this month will make 7 years. I have always dealt with my anxiety quietly, kept it to myself. Through the years things have gotten...darker. I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected. Content...never happy...always foggy...incapable of feeling anything but sadness I suppose, I just thought I was super empathetic lol I have never found enough ""joy"" in anything to have any hobbies, which has always bothered me. Well. Here we are...about 5 years of straight downhill later and two days ago I started to have some kind of breakdown of the century that really came to a head last night and at work this morning. I am scrambling to hold on to any sliver lining I can find. I am exhausted. I have cried for 2 days straight, had the most obsessive...intrusive thoughts that i cant seem to shake. I am absolutely sick to my stomach and can not hold anything down. I feel like the part of me that has been fighting has literally given up and is begging for help, this current person is scary as hell. My boss made me call every doctor that took my insurance to get an appointment  asap after my...""episode"". I have an appointment for in the morning. I am terrified. The thought of medication really fucks with my anxiety. I get paranoid a doctor is just going to prescribe me stuff (like they did my brother) to get rid of me with out really LISTENING to me. But I am going to cross my fingers and hope for whatever ""best"" I can find. There has to be more to this life than what I am currently living. I can not feel like this for forever, I won't. I have no idea how I am going to make it through the night, but I am going to figure it out. Do any of you have any suggestions of things I should bring up with the doctor to make the most of my first appointment?

"Hi. i need to post this. For the first time in my life i'm feeling lonely, i have always been extroverted and i have a lot of friends that i can call and hang out with but the last week i have been feeling lonely and depressed, manly because of a girl I like. 

I figured I needed to tell someone about it because i¬°m pretty shy and i don't want to tell any close friends of mine this. 

First of all, i¬¥m fat, and i feel bad about it I am trying to change it, I don¬¥t like it and i know how bad i look. I have never had a date before and i guess the main reason is because of the way i look, and because of that i haven't gathered the courage to ask anyone out. So, this girls just started working with me and i we started to talk to each other, many because we sit next to each other at the office, and because we both love reading and writing. I figured we had a lot in common so we started to talk about it. Last week I realized i like her a lot, i have never felt anything like it, but i'm really self conscious about the way i look and that if i tell her how i feel i will not know if i will be able to handle a rejection. I will still have to work with her and talk to her and i don't know if i will be able to do that. 

The holly day season didn't helped me either, this new year i spent it with my father at a restaurant and did absolutely nothing. I guess thats when i started to feel this way. 

I thought that telling anyone about this could help me understand why all of a sudden i'm feeling lonely and depressed and know what to do to change it. 

Thanks for reading/listening.

"Hello r/depression, I have been staring at my phone trying to call the samaritans (UK helpline) for the last hour. But I can't work up the courage to actually speak to a person so I came here. I've been wanting to kill myself recently; and the multi-storey car park I could jump from is a 15 minute walk away. Recently the temptation to go there is getting strong. 
The only time in my life where I don't feel constantly pushed down on by a crushing weight is now, when I'm in bed. When I'm at work I feel like everyone is against me or wants me out.

"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right?

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself.  The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried.

Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash.  Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world.  My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place.  Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression.

This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral .

I have been doing good depression wise.  Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it .

"I've been unhappy for a very long time. I am in high school and I'm currently on my winter break. I've hated school for the last 6 or so years. 

Even though I despise it, I generally do pretty well. In elementary school, I got 90's and stuff without much difficulty. But when I started high school, my marks were a lot lower and I realized I'm not smart like I thought I was. It took me until the last semester of grade 10 until I was satisfied with my grades. I got all 90s and I was pretty proud of myself. I even won an award for history. 

Now I'm in grade 11 and I'm getting 90s in every course except music. I actually am getting a 60% which was the lowest mark I have ever gotten in a course. I'm pretty devastated because I have been practising like crazy. My teacher is also pretty considerate and let me redo a few things which I continued to fuck up. If you are in music, you have to take band which I enjoy. But this year you have to take it twice a week. One of the days I have to stay at school until 7 pm and I always feel really sad after. I'm just not enjoying it anymore. I know I probably shouldn't take it next year, but it feels like such a waste since I've devoted so much time to playing my instrument. I just feel so shitty. The class average is a 91. I am pretty sure I'm getting the lowest mark in the class.

I enjoy getting high marks, but I am a horrible procrastinator and I always stay up to like 5 am working on assignments. I have no motivation until I absolutely need to get stuff done. I just feel horrible when I get low marks. Everyone at my school is uber competitive and I feel like garbage if I get anywhere below a 90. I hardly pay attention in class and I always save things until the last minute. It's like I enjoy making my life more difficult. School has gotten harder and the stress causes me to cry often.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't have very strong connections with any of my friends. I don't enjoy going places with people. And I feel uncomfortable talking to them outside of emails, texts, and Facebook messaging. One of my friends always makes jokes at my expense when we're around other people. I often make self-deprecating jokes, so I am normally okay with it. But he takes it a little too far sometimes. I'm not the best at controlling my emotions -- I smile and laugh at inappropriate times -- so when I try to tell him I don't enjoy it, he says that I'm lying.

A couple years ago I ended a friendship with an absolutely toxic person. I'm glad I ended it, but he was also one of the only people from my old school. I really felt betrayed by what he did to me, and it still kinda hurts. I don't have many friends.

Every single day is the same old bullshit. I just sit there at school waiting for it to be time for me to go home. And then I go home and do nothing until it's like midnight and I need to do my homework. I hate my routine, I wanted some sort of change. But then I got some change and I hate it so much.

A week before the winter break started I found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm scared and sad. I'm trying to remain optimistic but it doesn't look good. I had to spend that last week in class while my mom got subsequent testing. It was awful to have to wait all day at school. The worst was when one of her meeting with an oncologist was on the same day I had band. I had to wait until 7 until I found out anything. That's when I found out that she would be going through chemotherapy and then eventually surgery.

I had a history test that week. I'm sure I didn't fail it, but I don't think I got higher than a 90. This sucks because history was my best course and I felt proud of myself for once. And now I feel guilty for worrying about something as petty as a test.

Now it's over a week into the break and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I barely leave the bed. My passions are to read comics, watch movies, and I'm trying to write a screenplay. For the first few days of the break, I was mildly productive. But now I don't even do anything. I have so much to read but not enough energy to actually do it. I am wasting my break.

We found out that her cancer spread to her bones. They aren't going to have surgery anymore. She is going to go through months of chemo in hopes that they will just make the cancer controllable. Best case scenario, it's a lifetime condition that they just need to closely monitor. Luckily, the chemo that she is going through isn't as intense, so she is not incapacitated. She's still working and stuff. Her hair will still likely fall out in a week or 2. She has an MRI and a CT scan on Friday -- we'll know if it has spread to any organs. 

My sister is in town from university. I haven't really talked about it much with my sister or my dad. My dad seems like he is trying to ignore the whole thing. We're not the most talkative family.

I tried talking to a friend who doesn't go to my high school. He is extremely unhelpful. He barely reads the messages I send him. A week ago, I told him my mom was starting chemo the next day. And he immediately changed the subject to what he bought on Boxing Day. I get that it's awkward, but all I was looking for was a friend to talk to. I didn't message him again until today. I was also pissed that he didn't think of messaging me to ask how things were going with my mom. He was going through his own personal shit a few months ago, and I listened and tried to be a friend. I feel like this friendship is extremely one sided and I need to end it.

I love my sister, but she keeps on pressuring me to get my G1. I know I should, however, I just have no motivation whatsoever. And I feel like I would be an incompetent driver. I constantly fuck things up. I can barely get motivated to study for a test at school. I know driving isn't necessary at the moment, so I can't get motivated to study for it.

School is starting again on Monday. I'm going to have so much work to do because exams start at the end of January. I have so much work that I could be doing over the break, but I just keep putting it off. I have a group video or something due for history sometime after the break. My group wants to start filming Thursday or Friday. On Thursday, my mom has chemotherapy. And on Friday, my mom has more tests. Even if I do get a ride to someone's house, I'm going to be thinking of my mom all day. I don't want to be a jerk and screw over my group. But I really don't want to film those days. Also, I'm really not close to anyone in that group to tell them what's going on. It would be really uncomfortable telling them and I don't know what other day we could film. I also can't get motivated to do any work or research. 

I don't want school to start again. I hate it. It's so stressful and I'm so unhappy. I had so little motivation before I discovered my mom has cancer, and now I have even less. I know I'm going to have a shitty time.

I am starting to realize how screwed I am for university. I don't really have any accomplishments. I've done nothing significant. My only highlights are my grades, but they are not even that great and I don't know if I can keep them up. I want to be a screenwriter, yet I know that it is nearly impossible to be successful. I just know that I'm going to fail at it like everything else in my life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel alone and scared. I'm not suicidal (there are too many movies and television shows to look forward to even think about that). I am not very charismatic. Or athletic. Or smart. I doubt anyone will even read this.

I'd say my depression has slowly been growing since I was 12 and first googled reasons to live. 26 now and I try to live away from my family in other states or countries, though I always end up being financially dependent on my parents and returning back for Christmas time.

This year was particularly shit, I failed my uni course and turned smoking weed 24/7. I was only really sober for the first 5mins of each day before I'd start pounding cones. So my parents bought me a one way cross state ticket home. My parents are great caring people, which makes me feel terrible for not liking them (not that I'd ever tell them that).

Everytime I come back here my suicidal ideations get stronger and stronger. I've started seeing a psychologist here once a week,  paid for by my parents, and tried going up to 30mg of lexapro a day which along with weed withdrawal, if that even is a thing,  caused me to freak out and spend the day on suicide watch in hospital. So back to my regular 20mg. My parents want to keep me here, I guess they think they can help me, but I hate this house and all the old memories, accumulated junk and thoughts it gives me.  And I hate myself for hating the privileged middle class upbringing I have had.

After failing and withdrawing from university my student government support was cut and I had drained all my money on weed.

So now I feel stuck here where it all began, with no financial means to leave and no one to blame but myself. I keep telling myself I should choose life, but the other side of me seems I have had enough experiences of this world and suicide looks like such a beautiful, peaceful and final release into nothingness.

Thanks for being here r/depression, I find solace in reading your experiences and knowing that other people out there have their own similar battles. I've been getting battered with positivity from my family telling me to ""get outside and have a nice day in the sun"" or ""pull myself up by my bootstraps and get on with it"" or ""if you get a job you won't have time to think about it""
Once again I understand that this is them only caring and trying to help and once again I hate myself for hating their help.

"If you think getting someone to marry you and swear their everlasting love to you will make it any better, it doesn't. It just makes it harder because instead of having the freedom to break down and cry, you actually make another excuse to stay in the bath tub for 2 hours and just feel lonely, hopeless and isolated. 

And then after that, you come out of the bathroom and pretend work is stressing you out and act cheery and happy over dinner that you don't even taste anymore because literally everything is just not good anymore.

"My psychologist gave me a new med to try and it was amazing. I felt 90% percent back to my happy self when on just my other meds I'm about 50%. Colors seemed to be brighter and I found myself feeling happy most days. Best 6 weeks ever. 

When she gave it to me she told me to stop taking it if the new med messes with my stomach too much.

Well it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit.

I only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything.

I haven't stopped taking my other meds just the new one.

"Sorry for the wall of text i really need to vent and get some help or advice.


I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc.


when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess)


And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school.


My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world.

I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state?

I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down.

"SO i think i'm depressed. Like i feel really shitty the time and i honestly want to die. I don't know if i want to do that to my friends and family, but there's a really great girl out there and i wasn't good enough for her. I just turned 16 and i don't think that now is the time for me to leave. I haven't lived a full life yet and that's something i want to do. 

It's all about love for me. I loved that girl so much, and she loved me too but i was too fucked up. I needed more than she could give me and it was too much and she's gone and I get this feeling when i see her in my chest and stomach because when i see her she's happy and i'm just sitting here wanting to die. We still talk and she still likes me, but it doesn't help. I was too much and not enough at the same time. We broke up almost a month ago but it feels useless to try. I don't think she even loved me, even though she may have liked me a lot. If i killed myself she'd be destroyed and that's really why I can't. 

I feel really unmotivated I can't do my homework and midterms are in a few weeks but I honestly don't care anymore. I think I'm going to do everything I can to live for a while. By that i mean live as in experiences. I want to smoke and drink a lot which I've started to do in the past week because it's one of the only things I can enjoy. I used to be able to wrestle which I think would have saved me but I got an injury about a week after my breakup. I have friends that will listen but they don't hear me. All they do is give me advice on things they know nothing about and I'm sick of it. They only do that because they don't want to feel guilty. I know I'm becoming more of a burden than a friend as recently and it kills me.

I haven't really known that depression was a real thing until 9 months ago when i became friends with this really cool girl that to be honest sometimes annoys me, but she's my friend and i love her. She cut, and I honestly didn't really get it. I get it now though, and I wish I could go back to my old naive self. All my friends are naive. I think a lot of them think I'm fine now because the breakup was a little while ago and I don't like to talk to them about how I'm feeling. They're all guys and they're the type of guys who just focus on either school or girls or drugs or video games. My girl friends are the ones that give me shitty advice. A lot of them are depressed too so they can't help me as much and I get that.

I just want to feel her in my arms again. I want to feel the rush of saying I love you and hearing her say it back. I know It won't be the same, even if we do get back together because it wont be because I love her it will be because I need her. 

She's the only thing that makes me happy right now. She knows that, and for some weird reason she still talks to me and she still likes me and misses me but i know i'm not good enough. I feel like because I need her to feel happy, It means I'm not whole. I guess i'm not, like i feel really empty but even more than the empty lost lonely things is the feeling that i'm not good enough. I guess that's why i want to kill myself because i dont think i'm good enough. All i do is start stupid drama because i can't just be happy by myself. I know it's all my fault; I needed too much i gave too much I couldn't be enough for her. I'm just not a full person. I need her for my own happiness and I can't function without her. I'm so co-dependant and i don't know how anyone puts up with me anymore.

That's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  
  
So, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  
  
However, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  
  
It got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying ""it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds"". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a ""Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me"".  
  
I broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  
  
The breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were ""you finally thought all of it through"".  
  
Not longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  
  
After a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple ""was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?"". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: ""Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over"".  
  
I didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  
  
You might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  
  
I didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  
  
I know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again.

"I know right. The feels. I don't expect any responses. I just like this subreddit because it's good to get your thoughts out there every now and then. I reread all of this and I wrote way too much. It's basically just an essay about my current state of mind in regards to mostly romantic relationships. Normal relationships are a whole other story.

There is something fundamentally wrong with me. It's not even part of my depression I think. It's part of me. I don't feel human because I don't think I contribute anything to society, and what seems to be a lack of wanting to interact with society.

Am I okay with being alone? I like being alone. I will have a twinge of loneliness occasionally. I'm sure if I didn't have my online friends I would feel loneliness more. I feel like I lead two lives. A social life online, and a lone loser irl.

I'm wondering what is stopping me from finishing my okc profile. I don't want to put the pictures on there. I don't want to write anything positive about myself. But most of all I don't want to interact with any of them. I don't want to meet anyone.

And I don't think it's just a fear of men. I think it's a fear of people in general. What good are they to me? Relationships with real people are too complicated too exhausting. Making conversation is excruciating. I become way too invested in other people and they don't reciprocate. It's painful.

Physical contact scares me. But I want it at the same time too. I have memories of being very young and wanting to be carried. But no one would carry me. My dad would carry my sister then be too tired to carry me. I grew to hate touch. I hated it when distant relatives would visit and want to hug me or kiss me. My parents barely ever did that so why should some strangers.

The best days I've had recently have been the ones where I have been completely alone, completely uncontacted by family. And I usually spend them alone in my apartment. Like a zoo display.

Love and companionship. I crave it and hate it at the same time. I go through periods of extreme sexual frustration where I long to have a partner. But the thought of doing something so intimate with another human frightens me at the same time. Sex is a mystery to me still, at 26 years old. I've watched porn, I've read erotic fiction. I've read about techniques and experiences others have had. I can do things that are close enough with other people online. But the thought of meeting in person to do anything is scary. I've had opportunities but I don't want to follow through with them.

When I was 14, I had an online boyfriend. He lived a few hours away and we wanted to meet eventually (although even then I had my reservations). He was 4 years older than me. My parents knew nothing about him. When he called my house my mom yelled at him and told him to leave me alone. We pretty much broke up after that. I felt ashamed and stupid and very bad that I caused someone else pain at the same time. I worried my parents and I fucked up the guy. Can't do anything right. Anyway I believe that first ""love"" of mine, and its conclusion, left an impression on me. The worst part might've been that after the incident, my parents never really could talk to me about it. They would try and I would deny it because I didn't trust them. And they kind of just dropped it. Maybe it was worse in the end because it seemed like they didn't give a fuck and went back to doing whatever it is they do instead of parenting.

After that first one I fooled around here and there, and had a second serious boyfriend when I was about 16-17. He was 6 years older than me, and lived across the country. He was very sweet and never pressured me to meet up or anything. I know there's also the element of me being a minor and them being older. I was never abused though. Maybe emotionally confused at times.

These little contained online relationships satisfied me well enough. I could get emotional companionship and sexual release. Usually without having to see their face or have them see me. After those two I've dabbled in similar more casual encounters if I ever feel the need.

The only real life thing that happened was freshman year of college. There was a guy I found cute. He was in 90% of my classes. It seemed like he was flirting with me because he was always distracting me from my notes, and sitting next to me in lecture halls. I hugged him once, and felt really fucking awkward and hated it. My height. My height is awkward. But that's only a contributing factor. It's that it's unnatural to me. That whole stint ended badly with me putting myself out there and getting fucked over. And my way of getting over it was to cut him out of my life as much as I could, and apparently to give up on looking good and gain 20 lbs lol!

So why should I make a dating profile where I'm expected to meet them in person. It's not necessary. If I don't I won't have to risk being hurt or revealing how awkward I am. This whole profile business seems disingenuous. I misrepresent myself because in words/online I can seem amazing. I'm okay at taking pictures that make me look halfway decent. But I realized I look awful irl. And my personality does not match up. I'm pathetically ""shy"" you could call it; or just mentally ill. I hate having to write positive things about myself to make it seem like I'm all gung ho for dating and human interaction. I don't want to sell that false image. Then one day they just realize that I am just a big bundle of depression and anxiety. A burden they weren't signed on for.

I kind of digressed fro the original topic I wanted to dissect. I am not physically attracted to most people. I can find women beautiful sometimes. And recognize when someone meets society's standards of beauty/sexiness. This has torn me up inside for years. I'm so confused about my sexuality. Men are hardly ever physically attractive, but I enjoy their companionship. Women like I said are only rarely. For the most part, I can only be attracted to people if I know them for a while and get to know their personality.

I'm at a stage where people are just trouble to me. I don't want to deal with it. They've hurt me too much in the past so I guess it's that I've learned to stay away. Self preservation. I'm not a risk taker. I have not had many positive interactions with people. I try too hard to fit in. I just want to be unnoticed.

When I was younger I had fantasies of becoming a functioning adult. In my fantasy I would've already been married and had kids by now. I don't think that will ever happen. And I've pretty much accepted that and don't really care any more.

I think its this unenhanced version of sexual/emotional frustration that prevents me from trying harder to assimilate with society. To pursue the role of a lover or my ""endgame fantasies."" I know I would make an amazing girlfriend/wife/mother. I would devote my life to my potential loved ones. I'm probably the perfect fit for some gamer guy out there (minus my depression and anxiety and secret desire for constant attention). But it just doesn't seem worth the trouble of going through the motions to get there. What's the point?

"Hi guys. Not sure where to start.

I hate school. I am a Junior and I am a straight A student who takes harder classes. You might think that would make me tolerate school, but I absolutely abhor it. I take no pleasure in my success, I have a bad anxiety disorder which will often debilitate me. I recently transferred for reasons I will talk about later. Because I'm new, I have no close relationships with anyone, and it's honestly understandable considering the people in my classes either feel extremely douchey or disinterested. I was never good at making friends IRL anyways I guess, I always tried to keep my social life online. I hate my teachers too, they'll often make me feel like they're under-qualified and that I am not getting the material I will need for the exam. I wish I could drop-out, I really really do, but I have no justification if I'm doing well. I'm almost off Holiday break and I have never been more anxious in my life.

My parents literally do not know the pain and discourse they are putting me through. They recently bought their dream property and they've made me move into the the place and go to school there. My life was put on hold and rapidly changed instantly. The place is in the country and is so isolated; half the time I am there, I am alone. When you're anxious about school and are completely isolated, it is the worst feeling ever, and some days I feel like I am going to die there, unhappy. They thought I would like it as much as them, but I do not. I hate it so much, I just want to be somewhere with good internet, TV, and proximity to civilization. Unfortunately, even when I express my pain, it mostly goes unheard.

I have friends online, and we're all mostly like minded people. For a time, it was great because it was the only place where I felt actually welcomed. We play games together, but I cannot anymore because my parent's new place has satellite internet with data limits. Because of this, I have grown so distant from them. Whenever I can chat, I feel like a waste of space. Only one person has truly expressed interest in what I have to offer socially, but the rest seem distant. I had plans to meet these people, but now, I feel like it is a waste of time. This means my social life is in crisis mode, along with my sanity in my own home and with my patience with school.

I wish I could stop everything and relax. I know life doesn't work that way, but if it doesn't get better, I feel like I will burn out and go crazy. I wish I could stop. I'm probably going to regret making this post in the morning but whatever, I just need someone to acknowledge my pain and maybe give advice. I do go see a counselor but I can never open up.

So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean.

The last seven years have been rough.

I've been in and out of depression most of my life, without realizing it because I thought that was what normal was. Seven years ago (seven?!?!) I realized that I wasn't mentally healthy. At the same time I was going through other stuff, was self medicating with weed, and had no direction in life. I had a massive breakdown/depression. Barely got out of bed, wasn't going to classes, couldn't even hold a conversation. I sort of pulled out of it but not much has gotten better.

Ever since then, i've been fighting the good fight but with little to no results. I've basically lost all of my friends or don't talk to them much. Even when I do i can't get past the fact that i went/still am crazy and can't just relax around them. Pretty much the same with family. They're more or less supportive but holidays and get togethers are fucking painful. I usually try to drink myself into being social with varying effects. 

I forced my way to getting a degree, even in that depressed state, because I didn't know what else to do. No idea how I can use that degree. I'm working a shitty job at a bank now and seem on the verge of being fired. I don't have the energy to grin and bear it. Depression is not great for customer service. I don't want to work at a bank. But i don't know what else I can or want to do. 

I'm so fucking lonely. I have no idea what to do with my life. Every day is a seesaw between extreme lows of depression and extreme highs of serious anxiety. 

I was against antidepressants but at this point it feels like I need to try something drastic. I tried Lexapro a while back for a few months and didn't notice anything change.

Anyone have any thoughts? all this time and it still feels like I'm at square one. Would really appreciate anything helpful.

"Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me.

I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist  at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change. It's like this huge jumbled mess of what I call brain fog, anxiety, existential worry ( I just took two philosophy courses and have always been worried about life and death and religion), and depression.

"I do not consider myself as ever having had depression, but issues of conformity vs individuality, agnosticism/skepticism and romantic love vs. unconditional love for humanity have turned me to a dark place over this winter break and today during the first day of school. 

My relationship between me and my parents isn't close where we say we love each other, make physical contact, or talk a lot, and I fear it is my fault because of how difficult I was in the past possibly, and I also just don't feel love, give love, or subscribe to the idea of love much, only to helping people for the sake of helping people. I guess emotions really are a weak spot for me as an INTP. Many people upon meeting me have noted that I'm very cold and aloof. I was feeling angry at them recently for going against what I believed to be my personal and innate way of living, but now I am not sure. Today at school my teacher said ""how are you"" to me and this girl who had been bothering me for a long time, who I would get angry at but I had never talked to, who seemed to keep smiling at me and looking at me subtly as I would also look at her because I wanted to know what was going on, turned around slightly when she heard that and probably smiled. I still don't feel sure about her intentions but I think she was employing satirical techniques, which we just learned about in class today, and she is in my class, to try to prod me in the right direction, seeing how lonely and disconnected I was. (TO PUT ME OUT OF MY EGOTISM AND WEAK BUT DEEP TOXIC SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS.) Today in psychology my class also started learning about motivation and emotion, and that was eerily attuned to my situation, because in the past few nights I didn't have motivation to do the work I needed to do, so I failed to do it. I also was going through a lot of different emotions. 


I keep getting sudden feelings that my life has just significantly changed, like today, and I feel like I am so stupid and I don't know how I was able to feel normal before, how I could be blind to it, but it is just so confusing. I find it kind of hard to look back on the past few months and remember what I was thinking. I see myself as just kind of having been a zombie in the past.

So I felt very stupid today, and I was going through my classes in an obviously different mood, which I now regret because I think I looked weird in front of one of my teachers. I kept seeing different ways how I had failed to accept love and integrate it into my life, and how I was nothing without it, how I was such a failure in so many ways. I was considering seeing a school therapist, and I talked to the few friends I had about the day's events, causing stress for them probably. I was skeptical of the idea of love for a long time though, as I wanted to study it in psychology before deciding what to do on that subject, and I kept feeling like I should only love certain people, and not really like or dislike other people but just want to help them when possible. I was always very individualistic and recently I had this silly thought Satan would visit me one night because I could relate to Lucifer. I didn't want to put my faith into anything, not some god or even unconditional love really. But we trust our intuitions all the time anyway, and I don't know what to do. It might just be a kind of unnecessary and bad thing to care so much about being skeptical of everything, and doing so could be egotistic. I have had the idea in recent times that maybe I could completely get rid of the ego and not care how I did compared to others, only focus on being the best I could be. And I don't think that was an idea I didn't accept, I think I accepted that idea.

I should note I had loving feelings for a teacher I have and I was scared to ever interact with her besides just being in the class, but this was something I was holding on to and I had feelings of wanting more of it. Not being able to love makes me feel guilty all the time, and I think I was labelling my problem as not being able to make friends and being lonely but really it was not being able to get and give love with friends and people. I couldn't make friends because I didn't have the right view of people.",4,"issues of conformity vs individualism, agnosticism vs skepticism turend me into a dark place, realtions with parents not close, no , not being able to love meakes me guiltyreal friends, deep toxic sense of competitiveness"

"Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. 
Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. 

I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful.

"Earlier during dinner, my parents were discussing an acquaintance whose son was recently diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. Due to my (secret) lack of willingness to live, I said something to the effect of: ""If I was diagnosed with something horrible like that or even a terminal illness, I wouldn't do anything about it. I'd refuse treatment.""

Of course, like most good parents, they didn't like the idea of their son choosing to die in a situation like that, so we began arguing back and forth about it.

It got pretty heated. I was trying to express that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves and have that decision be respected. I still stand by this, of course, but I've always done much better with written words than spoken ones, and so I wasn't able to express my point very clearly. My emotions easily get the best of me, and it's really hard for me *not* to argue, even if I simultaneously believe that arguing usually hurts more than it helps.

And then, despite the argument getting a little more than heated, my dad calmly said something to the effect of ""I understand why you'd make a decision like that, but as your dad, I'd try my hardest to change your mind anyway. I'd never just let you kill yourself. I'd do whatever I had to do to keep you around. I don't know what I'd do if you were dead.""

I got blindsided by that, and I was almost in tears. I could see it on his face. He was truly, deeply terrified of the idea of me not being around. He wants me to live and be happy. For the first time in a long time, I was able to differentiate selfishness from somebody actually caring about me.

After dinner I spent the next half-hour alone, crying in my bed. My parents have no idea about the depression and anxiety I've suffered from the past six or seven years and how I think about killing myself every day, and how much it meant to me to hear that someone actually cared about my well-being.

I've said some bad things about my parents behind their back, and I feel bad about that. Really bad. None of this is their fault, and I need to do better not to blame them for it.

Realistically, I'm not sure if this changes my situation much. It was a simple reminder that there *are* people who care about me, people that are going to be really hurt if I commit suicide. Up until now, this never mattered to me. I was entirely selfish about it. I can't explain it, but hearing and seeing the concern my parents had for my well-being just *made* it matter, I guess. Maybe I do have a heart after all.

For all the time I've been on this board, I don't think I've ever made a positive post, and I just really wanted to share this with somebody. I actually feel a little better, a little more stable after today's events. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for responding. I'm glad this resonated with all of you. I'm going to push myself to be more open with my parents from now on.

I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side.

And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen.

"People I encounter, family, co-workers, employers, peers, use this demented perversion of Darwinism to suggest that I am unfit; that I have to be the one to adapt and adapt while the world remains static. They say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs adapt for die‚Äù, and if I can‚Äôt adapt then I don‚Äôt deserve to be successful. Many people act as though because I am different that the onus falls entirely upon me to change myself. If I am a round peg and the only opening is a square hole, then I am expected to what, use brute force to fit in? There‚Äôs no concern for personal tolls it takes to force myself into a place I don‚Äôt fit into, and if I can‚Äôt handle the pressure, the personal damage incurred by that process, then I get labeled defective, mentally unfit. My father tells me to follow the Marine Corps motto of, ‚Äúadapt, improvise, overcome‚Äù, but life is not a military operation.

Instead of people trying to meet me half way, instead of people seeing the value in diversity of thought and trying to accommodate me even in the slightest, I am condemned for not being endlessly adaptable. I am not some ‚ÄúUbermench‚Äù, capable of endless internal rearrangement, I am a human person! Of course I can change, I can adapt, but I can‚Äôt be someone entirely different; I‚Äôm not clay you can just reshape over and over again! 

I suppose it‚Äôs easy to level such criticisms when you are aren‚Äôt different, when you‚Äôre not the one being told to give up what makes you who you are; when you‚Äôre a square peg trying to fit into a square hole. People who don‚Äôt have these difficulties say to me, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you just be like me? If I could be successful, anyone could, so if you can‚Äôt it‚Äôs because your just being obstinate and unreasonable; it‚Äôs your fault and you need to change‚Äù. Others take a more defeatist, pragmatic view and say, ‚Äúthe world won‚Äôt change, so you need to. If you try to be different you‚Äôll just be tilting at windmills. That‚Äôs just the way it is, so just conform to what‚Äôs expected of you and be pretend to be happy about it.‚Äù 

It makes me bitter, and people see that bitterness as unjustified and roll their eyes at it, only serving to intensify my bitter feelings. Why wouldn‚Äôt I feel bitter? I struggle and struggle, only to have others devalue my experiences and scoff at my pain; to label me with all sorts of offensive stereotypes and make no effort to understand my position. People say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be bitter, it‚Äôs not attractive‚Äù, but what else am I supposed to feel? I‚Äôm sorry the way I feel isn‚Äôt attractive, but it‚Äôs the way I feel and no amount of scorn and disapproval is going to change that. Wouldn‚Äôt you feel bitter in my shoes? Fighting an uphill battle to just be yourself, without support, without validation of any sort, while no one seems to take you seriously? Am I supposed to just lie and counterfeit myself my entire life? What sort of life is that? It‚Äôs one thing to struggle for find you path in life, it‚Äôs another to have those who already have spit on me the whole way.  

My therapist once told me to pretend to fit in, to just fake it until I feel it, but I never felt it; I just feel more and more empty and dead inside. I feel progressively hollow, depleted, eroded away. I fear that one day there will be nothing left of me, that eventually I‚Äôll be nothing more than a zombie, shuffling from place to place without thought, without feeling.

If I could I would be someone else, but I can‚Äôt. I only hope one day someone will value me for who I am, instead of who they want me to be.

"I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while just to see how other people deal with their depression in hopes that it could maybe help me but for the first time I feel a need to reach out to the community. 

I'm a 21 year old 5'6 asian male adopted into a white family living in the predominantly white New Hampshire, so I've always felt like a bit of an outsider. being adopted I've always felt more indebted to my parents than a real kind of love, so to tell them that I'm unhappy with my life seems like I would be a disappointment to them after all they've done for me. please don't be mistaken, I love them more than anyone else in the world but it's a conflicted and strange kind of love that's hard to describe and hard to understand even for me. 

Being in college I have friends who are mostly tall white guys who are either in relationships, or have sex with random girls fairly regularly. I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like ""getting girls is easy"" or ""I can't believe you're never with a girl"" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of ""I have a boyfriend"", ""you're not my type"", even ""I'm a lesbian"" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.
(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)

recently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. 

Depression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is ""Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else"". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real. I don't think I could ever do it purely based on how it would destroy my family but I'm wake up every day hating myself. 

Honestly thank you to anyone who listened, this is something I have never told anyone, but I needed to tell someone about this monster I'm fighting.

Thankfully, I don‚Äôt own a gun, and probably don‚Äôt have the balls to do it, but nonetheless, that is my first thought every single morning. But every day I drag out of bed and continue to live, except for on my days off, in which I rarely make it out of bed, and if I do, it‚Äôs just to drink for awhile.

Now a little back story with what I am dealing with tonight. I fell in love at first sight about 25 years ago. Many things happened that made a relationship impossible, and we never acted on our feelings until about 8 years ago. At that time, he had a girlfriend. He left her for me, but due to sticky circumstances we never officially got together (aka living together, etc.) We did spend a really great few years spending almost every day together, travelling a lot and falling in love, or so I thought. Things came to a head after a while, it was a ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù relationship from the start due to the aforementioned sticky circumstances. 

About 5 years ago, he met someone else and fell in love with her. She is a very possessive, controlling, manipulative type. She‚Äôs gotten his head so twisted up, there have been times he has wanted to commit suicide, and comes to me. He went almost a year in the relationship without telling me at all. Once I found out, he continued to break up with her (or her with him) every few months for a week or so and would spend it with me, just to go back to her and drop me like I was nothing. She is a horrible person. From the very beginning I tried to be cordial with her, because I never blame ‚Äúthe other woman‚Äù when a man cheats. But she treated me like ‚Äúthe other woman‚Äù from the start, even though we were together first.  As a matter of fact, her first words to me ever were to taunt me saying she ‚Äúhas my man all the time‚Äù. At one point during one of his suicidal episodes, I sat right next to him as he texted her saying he wanted to kill himself, and her response to him was ‚ÄúDo it‚Äù.

The last year or so, the break ups have waned, and we honestly have not seen or talked much at all. Our split broke my heart, and I was really just starting to get over it, starting to ‚Äúlearn to live half a life‚Äù like the song goes.  
Two months ago, he called me and asked me to take some time off over the holidays because she was going out of town and he wanted to spend a few days together. At first I was reluctant, because in the past we only ever did this when they were broken up. But I agreed because I just miss him so much, I can‚Äôt even describe it. I knew I had to end it, but my plan was to spend a last few days in happiness with him then to tell him to let me go. Let things end on that note, give me some closure at least. 

So I took some time off. He called me a few weeks later to tell me he had the dates wrong, and I even went so far as to change my vacation time (even though my boss is not open at all to that sort of thing). I got new tires, got the car serviced so we could take a trip. It‚Äôs really been the only thing keeping me going the last few weeks, knowing that I was going to be happy for a few days. 

Well, the time comes to take the trip. He calls me the night before, telling me he will call me when he wakes up and we can leave. The next morning, I‚Äôm packed, just waiting for his call, could not even sleep the night before because I was so excited. 

That was yesterday morning. I still have not heard a word from him. I finally called his phone tonight and another man answered, saying he was him. Of course I recognized the voice and knew it wasn‚Äôt him. The man asked me who I was and when I told him my name he said I have the wrong number and hung up. I have sent him a couple of messages with no reply.

So here I sit now wondering how I let myself fall for this, how I let myself go so far out of my way and get my hopes up so much just to be crushed. Again. I wonder if he did all this intentionally just to hurt me, or if something came up, maybe she came home early. I know I have no right to be upset because it was I who was planning on running away with another woman‚Äôs man, but I am still upset. Devastated. So let down I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself.

I know whatever the outcome, a day from now I will be in the same situation I would have been anyways. I would have ended it for good, and still will, but I guess I had in my mind how that was going to go, and this is not what I had planned. 

I just need to know how to get this weight off my chest, this lump out of my throat, how to force myself to eat or even get out of bed (except to drink which makes it worse). I thought about using the rest of my vacation doing something productive, but I seriously cannot even. I just don‚Äôt understand why he would do this to me. I never asked for this, he planned it all, just to let me down again. And for what? And I can‚Äôt even yell at him, because he won‚Äôt speak to me. Half of me just wants to tell her everything just to get revenge, just to hurt him too. But I know that will only make me feel worse. 

I wonder what I ever did to be treated like this. I wonder how I can keep living. I was in a very bad mental state before this, and I‚Äôm afraid this might just put me over the edge. I guess I just needed someone to hear my story. So here it is.

I long for the friendship that Max and Cloe had. 

I never had any close friends, they were never caring and we lost ways. I spent my entire life alone, I wish I could have had a meaningful lasting friendship.

I want to live in the gorgeous small town close by the beach and forest.

That and I haven't dated anyone recently and my dating experience at the age of 33 is pretty spotty. Never been in a relationship either. 

Right now I feel like I need to focus on getting a job and getting back in shape because I've fallen off the wagon a bit. Also, I probably should try to get into some sort of activity where I could make some friends. Although, it feels like no one wants to make new friends the older you get.

But I knew him for two years. He had just gotten out of one abusive relationship and into another. I was there both times. I assure you I didn't do to try to get with him. I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back.

Now he's back with his ex again. And I hope he suffers. Bad. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being a freak. Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up.

"Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing.

 My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? 

I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. 


I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... 


I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. 


It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. 


Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. 


But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward.


I dunno why I posted this really. Maybe I just want people to at least see that I'm not all there.

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

I even forget my age.

I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3.

I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid.

You don't listen.

I deleted the post cause I was a fucking liar. I talked as if I was staying strong for him. I was in a psychiatric  facility twice when he was dying. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't even close to him but God did it fucking hurt knowing he was leaving me.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.

After years of miserable group work,I realised that no one accepts my opinions,this time was stupid as I am one of the best students at art,and NO ONE asked my for help,they kept calling me irrelavant and useless.So I decided to sweep the classroom,as Singaporeans,we never-EVER,clean up after one another,So the class looked like the aftermath of a party,From then,I started sweeping for hours,instead of appreciating me efforts to help,many just laughed at me for being that ""Cleaner boy"" and others made facial expressions that looked like I was bothering them,whenever I went to their side to clean up.

After that,I went for a rest,at my seat,which a group of people are working on stuff on,when I jokingly said a joke (Obviously),they just shooed me off and called me ""The useless one"",seriously,did no one realise how clean the room was after I swept?

Now the most horrible part:Some time later,get this,MY TEACHER COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW THE CLASSROOM WAS DIRTY!At this point I was all ready to commit murder already,fucking trashwhore,If i didn't make an effort to clean up the class,I tell you,bitch,your classroom will look like a fucking garbage disposal.

I went up to a group of kids,and kindly asked if they got any trash for me,one of them said: ""YOU!""

"I'm gonna write an essay venting here so incoming wall of text.

I see a lot of posts on here which revolve around unemployment, lack of academic achievement, ""failure"" in one aspect or another, and I can relate to those things, but I'm on the other side and I feel worse now more than ever.

I've always had depression come and go, and maybe that's generally normal, but I did relatively well for myself anyways. I had fun in college, met some really cool people, was in a frat and a few other organizations, generally had a good time. I don't think I've ever had a close friend but that never really bothered me, I am super introverted by nature and can easily spend a month without human contact and be just fine. I graduated with a good major and good grades, I got a good job right out of college at an employer that hires 1% of applicants, 3 months later I quit because I got an offer from another employer that hires even more selectively, I moved to a cool city on the west coast. I don't have any large insecurities, I feel that I'm relatively smarter than most people, a good employee and a person worth hiring at any job in my field. I do fine with women generally, never had a serious girlfriend because I always lose interest in people and I prefer being alone when I'm not working because I find people to be exhausting.

I have a cool apartment in the downtown area, I have a ""great job"" which people are jealous of, old friends hit me up asking for interview advice and references. I'm 23 and on my way to making 6 figures relatively soon.

I did everything right, my parents are proud of me, everyone treats me well, and even more so when they know you're successful and have money, but that can be an entirely different post. All this doesn't even matter because I'm more depressed today than I ever have been.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I have no true for ambition for corporate life, I find everything to be pointless and stupid, I'm really fucking good at pretending to be ambitious, and telling people what they want to here which is why interviewing has always been easy for me. But at my core, I don't give a fuck about anything, I feel like a zombie working from 9-7 every weekday to finally reach the weekend, have it fly by and then rinse and repeat. I really just want to do NOTHING, maybe read something I enjoy, play some video games, or find a new hobby or whatever but working makes me want to kill myself more and more everyday. 

Does that make me lazy as fuck? Probably, I don't know, that's what I get told whenever I express discontent with the work life. I don't care about material things beyond a few necessities and some hobbies. If I had enough money to pay my rent and a little extra for the rest of my life I would quit immediately.

My only goal in life is to have enough money so I don't need to have anymore goals. Goals are bullshit, ""oh if I work really hard I can be the financial MANAGER in a few years and make more money, then I can get a cooler apartment or a nice house and continue slaving away until I'm an old man die."" It's all just bullshit, who gives a fuck. Why would I want a job with more responsibilities which gives me more money I don't use, it all feels like a giant joke.

The only hope that keeps me going is somehow finding a way out and having enough money/passive income to retire, but the thought that it may take 15 years or more makes it seem useless. I feel like my youth is slipping away, I'm tired everyday, I have trouble sleeping, even my hair is starting to fall out which is fucking depressing.

I have a few thousand in savings after sending money home to support my parents, with barely any free time or energy to find something I can invest in. I'm stuck working and watching time fly by week after week. It feels like a hopeless cycle with no escape, like no matter what I do I'm destined to working some zombie office job until I'm an old man until I can finally retire and die. I want to throw all my money in a business idea or something but with my current energy and time and mental state, I would probably fail miserably and lose all my money and go back to square one.

Everything is depressing, I just want to disappear.

But the depressed, brooding me scoffs.. It's like the depressed me knows this cycle is never going to end... The change that my sometimes-optimistic self hopes will happen, nah, not gonna happen.

I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks.

Does the mind rule the body or does the body rule the mind ?..

.I'm in a really strange place right now. I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. 

For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out.

Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. 

Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? 

I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ?

" I walked in on my first day of high school a depressed kid. i made some friends, they showed me that life is more than just moping around and working to get a diploma to mope and work more. They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them.

That was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. 

I want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. 

i just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world

tl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?",5,"walked first day of school as depressed kid, made some grate friends, want to kill self but concerend about friends, family and everyone in contact, keep smiling and repress emotions"
"I wish it would go away.  My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope.  Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless.  Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control.  I had no choice in my existence.  Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.  Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first.  As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate.  The real struggle is to create something more.  I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.  I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.

"I have been depressed for the past 3 years. In the last year my mind descended into the darkest depths. I had thoughts I never could have imagined myself having. However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it. I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with depression and could give me tips on what they did to slowly rehabilitate themselves to their former mental space before depression. I know I will never be 100% and perfect but right now it's like my mind is a fog and it's slowly clearing but I haven't seen sunshine in so long and part of me still wants to stay in the fog because it's comfortable and I am used to it.",0,
"I've personally thought about it -- several times a week when times were bad, and each time it was ruled out as a non-viable solution. I do, however, consider it an option on the table if circumstances call for it. 

The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide.

I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.""

There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering.

"Im sitting in my bathroom 1/5th deep with a belt wrapped around my neck just trying to get something out. I am generally a relatively passive depressed person. I feel like I am hyper-aware of my situation but I don't feel emotion like I should although I feel it welling up in me. 

Why can't I cry? I feel like if I could ball my eyes out I would be fine after but I just can't do it. I am usually content with my emotions but probably once a week I get this feeling that I need to coax them out to get some sort of release. It's like there is this immense pressure inside me and all I need to do is turn a valve but I can't find the right one.

I want to die. I am very close with my family which stops me, but only because I can't stand the idea of putting them through that. I understand that I am lucky to have people who love me so much but more often than not it feels more like a burden than a blessing. 

Im not super emotional that I want to die, rather i'm pretty passive about it. In my mind this seems a completely logical solution to my problems. I still love my ex girlfriend, I have self-esteem issues etc but at this point none of that really seems a factor to me. I have felt this way for a long time, much longer than my present problems are responsible for.

I have friends who are enlightened as to my situation and they try to help but everything they say goes in one ear and out the other. I don't think I'm actually going to do it tonight. My mother always jokingly said that you should always keep your house clean in case you died tomorrow. I feel that way now. There are loose ends to be tied up before I did anything definite.

It would be so much easier. It frustrates me, no it pisses me off sometimes that suicide is considered such a selfish thing. What about me? What about what I feel? Is a life lived for other's comfort really worth living?

I guess what scares me at this point is that the idea of suicide doesn't scare me anymore. I have my ideas about what might come after and I think it's eternal peace. Afterlife or not (veering towards not) I have the opportunity of eternal rest in front of me so why not?

"I'm sitting here just reading all your guy's and girl's posts feeling like all you are. Let me just share whats going on in my life for a moment...

I'm 25 living with one of my grandparents taking care of her because she's old and can't get around. I love her to death and would do anything for her, but I would never tell her any of this because I feel like I need to shoulder everything. She is battling her own grief due to the loss of her closest sister and sister-in law. It was two weeks ago when one of my aunts past away (grandmas sister-in-law) and four months who I was closest (and my grandmas sister) with, who was my whole world. The hole in my heart just keeps getting bigger and I don't know how to stop it. She use to be my compass and now I feel completely lost without her. I also took care of her for about the last eight months of her life and felt like it just went by so quickly. I traveled with her when I was younger and had so many memories... now knowing shes gone I can't help but cry whenever something that reminds me of her pops up in my head.

I also got out of a six year relationship about two years ago which was horrible and I have a lot of scars (emotional) that I still haven't shaken off. I've been battling with loneliness and depression for a long time now. We would constantly fight towards the end of our relationship, but there was a time she showed me what it was like to have a real connection with someone. I pursued one or two other women after the one, but they never were looking for anything serious. I have friends who complain about their girlfriends/boyfriends and I just sit their sometimes thinking to myself...at least you have someone. I would give anything I feel to have a connection with anyone now a days, I feel like when it comes to being by myself I go into a dark corner in to my mind I can never escape. Almost feels like I'm sinking into a giant ocean and I can see the light slowly fading away and this huge amount of pressure keeps crushing me. 

I have a few friends and a lot of family members, and their company is like a drug that I try to cling on to. Two of my friends are kind of close, but they have their own lives and we don't see each other often. Most of my other friends are gone in other schools far away. My family also is kind of disconnected. When we get together it can be amazing, but their something inside myself that clicks and I hide my depression with them. They always can have a blast with each other but I feel so disassociated with them I don't feel like I belong. When it comes to parting ways I know what comes next when I'm by myself. I've told one of my relatives once, but they couldn't understand what I was going through. I've told my mom also, but she just doesn't quite know exactly what I'm feeling. She tries, but it just hurts me knowing I'm misunderstood. My friends wouldn't understand so I never tell them. 

I try to keep myself busy by going to school, reading, video games, leaving but the escape is only brief. I can't find a permanent cure for what I'm feeling. I just find myself laying in bed most of the time....trying to battle myself and never winning. Its been a few years...and I'm still depressed.

"My depression has taken everything. I'm nearly 30 and been suffering with depression for 10 years. 

It just gets worse. I lost my girlfriend. I can't work. I can't  be around for my family. I had to move in with with my Mum in a tiny box room that I can't be bothered to keep clean.

I've been in bed for two days, I haven't even showered. I barely eat.

I'm on my second medication and this one has no effect either. I'm on the waiting list for therapy but it will be months before I can speak to someone.

I my life is just getting wasted and there's no sign things will get better.

No question to ask of Reddit, just sharing my experience.

Happy 2017

"Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old male from Australia. I'm very new to reddit and I thought that this is one of the most important message boards. I've had depression since I was approximately 15 after I lost a friend to suicide. My psychologist also believes I have borderline personality disorder. The whole point of this post is to say thank you for existing, you are not alone.",3,borderline personality disorder
"Not sure how to start this. So ill start by telling a few things about my life.

I am a 23 years old male, living in brazil, currently working with IT. 

My parents and my girlfriend are really supportive and i don't really have big problems in my life, which leads to the big issue: i feel like complete shit.

Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse.

I have tried suicide in the past and these thoughts are behind me, but the feeling of being worthless and that im not accomplishing anything haunt me everyday. 

I would appreciate some help on this.

Thank you and Sorry for the rant.",5,"parents and girlfriend really supportive,, donít understand why I feel like this makes me feel even worse"
"I want to scream but I dont have the energy. I love staying up for hours afraid to go to sleep because the dreams taunt me with a life I should have had. I love it fucking YAY I LOVE DEPRESSION AND I LOVE THESE NIGHTS.

Its so evil. It tears your soul apart and leaves you empty and tired while every neuron wants to scream. The mind is screaming but the body is drained",0,
